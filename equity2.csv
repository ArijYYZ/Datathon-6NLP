A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting New-onset Depression in a Military Population,"Objective: Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States in both civilian and military populations, but few prospective studies assess a wide range of predictors across multiple domains for new-onset (incident) depression in adulthood. Supervised machine learning methods can identify predictors of incident depression out of many different candidate variables, without some of the assumptions and constraints that underlie traditional regression analyses. The objectives of this study were to identify predictors of incident depression across 5 years of follow-up using machine learning, and to assess prediction accuracy of the algorithms. Methods: Data were from a cohort of Army National Guard members free of history of depression at baseline (n = 1951 men and 298 women), interviewed once per year for probable depression. Classification trees and random forests were constructed and cross-validated, using 84 candidate predictors from the baseline interviews. Results: Stressors and traumas such as emotional mistreatment and adverse childhood experiences, demographics such as being a parent or student, and military characteristics including paygrade and deployment location were predictive of probable depression. Cross-validated random forest algorithms were moderately accurate (68% for women and 73% for men). Conclusions: Events and characteristics throughout the life course, both in and outside of deployment, predict incident depression in adulthood among military personnel. Although replication studies are needed, these results may help inform potential intervention targets to reduce depression incidence among military personnel. Future research should further refine and explore interactions between identified variables.  2021 The Authors. Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. on behalf of the American Psychiatric Association","To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use classification trees and random forests to assess predictors of probable incident depression in a military sample. We found that, among both men and women, traumas and ACEs (particularly verbal abuse by a parent or guardian), stressors such as being emotionally mistreated, and demographics such as being a current student were predictive of incident depression during follow_up. Military characteristics (e.g., paygrade), low psychosocial support, and hearing about traumas happening to friends or family (e.g., a friend was in a serious accident) appeared more predictive of depression for women than for men, whereas PTSD, deployment location, personally experienced traumas (including combat_related experiences), and financial problems appeared more predictive among men compared to women.

Among men, recent deployment to a nonconflict area was predictive of depression, compared to being deployed to either a conflict area (Iraq or Afghanistan) or never having been deployed. This may be due to stressful and unexpected domestic deployments to areas affected by natural disasters—which have been increasing in recent years—or to areas of civil unrest after riots or massive protests, which can involve National Guard deployment. These types of domestic deployment may be more distressing for soldiers than combat deployments overseas, because they can involve confronting fellow citizens (e.g., at protests that become violent) or witnessing citizens suffer (in natural disaster contexts). This finding should be replicated, but it could indicate that additional resiliency training may be warranted for these unique deployment experiences. We were unable to compare incidence of depression by exact location or type of recent deployments, given small cells and lack of detailed questions on the surveys.

Past_year PTSD was the most predictive variable for incident depression among men in the single tree (and moderately predictive in the random forest, suggesting there may have been some overfitting in the single tree). This finding is broadly consistent with both with the only other study to use random forests to predict incident depression in a population_based sample (31) and with many non_machine learning studies that have consistently found comorbidity between PTSD and depression (32, 33, 34, 35). The combination of having both past_year PTSD and reporting a unit casualty during the most recent deployment was particularly predictive of depression among men in the classification tree, for which the incidence of depression was 73.3%, or five times larger than the overall incidence of depression among men in this sample.

Among women in our study, PTSD was not predictive of incident depression, but lifetime PTSD status was included in the algorithm instead of past_year status, given the small number of women with PTSD in the past year in an already_small sample of women. This may be the reason why PTSD was not selected among women as being highly predictive, since history of PTSD may have occurred many years before onset of depression, and thus not as clinically or statistically relevant.

Our findings that ACEs and more recent traumas and stressors were predictive of incident depression (for both men and women) is also consistent with a prior machine learning study (31) as well as many non_machine learning studies that have modeled incident or prevalent depression with similar types of events as exposures or predictors (36, 37, 38). Traumas and stressors such as being mistreated have long been known to associate with depression outcomes (39, 40, 41, 42), particularly when they occur during childhood, while brain is still developing (42, 43).

Finally, our findings on financial problems, being a student, being of lower paygrade, and having children may all be related to financial stress, debt, and concern about being able to provide for one's family, which have been found in non_machine learning contexts to be associated with depression (44, 45, 46, 47).

Based on 10_fold cross_validation, our random forest algorithms were moderately accurate overall (73% accuracy for men and 68% for women). These values are in line with other studies predicting depression outcomes; Kautzky and colleagues (18), who used random forests to predict treatment_resistant depression, found accuracies of 68%–75%. Similarly, Jin and colleagues (17), who used four different prediction methods including random forests to model depression (also measured using the PHQ_9) among patients with diabetes, found comparable levels of accuracy (approximately 73%).

Limitations of our study include the use of baseline information alone to predict incident depression over follow_up. It follows that we lack (a) time_varying information assessed on the follow_up surveys that could be temporally closer to onset of depression compared to baseline variables, and (b) information on exact timing of prior events and experiences, as the baseline surveys primarily assessed events that occurred at some point in the past, without asking detailed information on timing (with the exception of other mental disorders). However, using only baseline predictors in this study established temporality between our predictors and outcome—a crucial aspect of valid prediction.

Another limitation is our use of the PHQ_9 for measuring depression. Although the PHQ_9 has been validated against a gold standard depression measure within this cohort as well as in many other populations (24, 25), it is primarily a screening tool and was not designed as a diagnostic test. Thus, it is possible that there are individuals in this study with incorrectly classified depression status, which could have affected which variables were chosen as being predictive. Future studies should aim to replicate these results using diagnostic measures of depression.

Finally, we used a complete case analysis for the cross_validated random forests. Missing data in this study stem primarily from the fact that ACEs were not asked on the baseline survey for the first (and largest) cohort of participants. For those individuals, the ACEs were assessed in the second wave of the study, at which not all respondents were present. A smaller portion of missing data came from responses of “don't know” or declining to answer questions such as income. As this is a prediction study and thus we are not aiming to isolate and measure the effect of any particular variable on depression, missing data are not as problematic of an issue as in an explanatory study. Generally, missing data among predictors in prediction modeling are thought to only create bias if missingness is related to the outcome variable (9, 48). We have no reason to believe that this is the case in our study, as all predictors are from the baseline interview, at which time the outcome had not yet occurred (with the exception of the four ACEs assessed at Wave 2 for the primary cohort, which were missing by design, not by refusal to answer).

Despite these limitations, these results may help inform potential screening interventions for depression in this population. Algorithms represent concrete ways officials might identify characteristics associated with high risk of developing outcomes, regardless of underlying causal relationships; this might be especially useful in a military setting given that military personnel are feasible to monitor. For example, the REACH Vet algorithm, built by researchers using machine learning, helped the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs to identify veterans at high risk for suicide (49, 50), as part of a crucial undertaking at a time when suicides among military personnel have been increasing.

Future analytic work that aims to predict depression—preferably using larger samples and more specifically timed predictors than we were able to utilize in this study—should aim to replicate our findings and further refine interactions between variables identified here. Machine learning might also be used to predict particular subtypes of depression, given that the overall disorder is heterogeneous and takes on different forms in different individuals; this may improve prediction accuracy. Predictive accuracies of the algorithms could also be compared with individual_level prediction using more traditional types of regressions, or using other types of machine learning algorithms, including ensemble methods such as Super Learner which average across different types of algorithms. Finally, broader environmental and context_level variables—like unit_level characteristics in a military study or residential neighborhood_level characteristics in a general population survey—may be important for prediction of individual incident depression (51, 52), and should be included as predictors in future studies, where sampling designs allow."
A machine learning ensemble to predict treatment outcomes following an Internet intervention for depression,"Background Some Internet interventions are regarded as effective treatments for adult depression, but less is known about who responds to this form of treatment.Method An elastic net and random forest were trained to predict depression symptoms and related disability after an 8-week course of an Internet intervention, Deprexis, involving adults (N = 283) from across the USA. Candidate predictors included psychopathology, demographics, treatment expectancies, treatment usage, and environmental context obtained from population databases. Model performance was evaluated using predictive R2 (R2pred) the expected variance explained in a new sample, estimated by 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation.Results An ensemble model was created by averaging the predictions of the elastic net and random forest. Model performance was compared with a benchmark linear autoregressive model that predicted each outcome using only its baseline. The ensemble predicted more variance in post-treatment depression (8.0% gain, 95% CI 0.8-15; total R2pred = 0.25), disability (5.0% gain, 95% CI -0.3 to 10; total R2pred = 0.25), and well-being (11.6% gain, 95% CI 4.9-19; total R2pred = 0.29) than the benchmark model. Important predictors included comorbid psychopathology, particularly total psychopathology and dysthymia, low symptom-related disability, treatment credibility, lower access to therapists, and time spent using certain Deprexis modules.Conclusion A number of variables predict symptom improvement following an Internet intervention, but each of these variables makes relatively small contributions. Machine learning ensembles may be a promising statistical approach for identifying the cumulative contribution of many weak predictors to psychosocial depression treatment response.  Cambridge University Press 2018.","This study used an ensemble of random forests regression trees and
elastic net machine learning approaches to predict symptom
change in response to Deprexis, an Internet intervention for
depression. In contrast to many prior studies (DeMasi et al.,
2017), we determined whether the ensemble predicted significantly more variance in post-treatment outcomes than a benchmark lin-
ear regression model that only included the baseline assessment
of the outcome. Candidate predictors ranged from patient demo-
graphics, to comorbid psychopathology, past and current treatment
utilization, to environmental characteristics based on the partici-
pants’ residence (i.e. postal code in the USA). In summary, the
ensemble outperformed an autoregressive linear benchmark
model for the prediction of interviewer-rated depression symptoms
(8% gain in variance explained, 25% total variance explained),
symptom-related disability (5% gain in variance explained, 25%
total variance explained), and well-being (12% gain in variance
explained, 29% total variance explained).
Results provide important new insight into who is most likely
to respond to Internet interventions such as Deprexis. Not unex-
pectedly, pre-treatment assessments were the strongest predictors
of each outcome. However, a number of additional predictors, all
making relatively small contributions to the prediction, were asso-
ciated with symptomatic improvement. The ensemble indicated
that comorbid psychopathology was an especially important pre-
dictor of post-treatment HRSD, particularly total psychopath-
ology and dysthymia (other psychopathology symptoms were
also identified as important predictors). This may not be surpris-
ing, as past research has indicated that comorbid psychopathology
is often associated with poor treatment response (Smits et al.,
2012). Also consistent with prior research, pre-treatment disabil-
ity was an important predictor of symptom change (Kessler et al.,
2017). High pre-treatment impairment has been shown to predict
poor treatment response across both pharmacological and psy-
chological treatment modalities (Trivedi et al., 2006; Frank
et al., 2011; Jarrett et al., 2013), but does not appear to moderate
response to any specific form of treatment (Kessler et al., 2017).
Nevertheless, impairment appears to be an important, non-
specific predictor of treatment response.
The ensemble was also able to predict additional variance in
post-treatment well-being beyond the benchmark model.
Comorbid dysthymia, disinterest, depression symptoms, and
mania symptoms were all important predictors of well-being.
Further, treatment credibility and treatment expectancies were
relatively strong predictors of symptom change. Self-guided inter-
ventions should consider incorporating interventions that
enhance patient expectations about treatment effectiveness and
treatment credibility, as initial expectancies have predicted treat-
ment engagement and outcome in psychotherapy and Internet
treatments (Greenberg et al., 2006). Although positive expecta-
tions are sometimes dismissed as mere ‘placebo’ processes,
which need to be controlled in trials, we concur with others
that such factors can fuel treatment engagement and improve out-
comes (Kirsch et al., 2016). As with the HRSD, disability across
multiple domains was also an important predictor of post-
treatment well-being.
A final aim was to examine the differential association of
Deprexis module usage to the three post-treatment outcomes.
Usage of the relationships, acceptance, and relaxation modules
appeared to be the most closely associated with the depression-
related outcomes. Notably, this study is among the first to identify
specific module dosages that are associated with symptom
improvement. For each of the modules, symptom reduction
appeared to taper off after approximately 30–50 min of usage. Prior work has found that module completion is modestly asso-
ciated with improvements in depression (Spek et al., 2007).
Much of this prior work has examined a linear relationship
between usage and symptom improvement, even though there is
evidence that this association may be non-linear (Donkin et al.,
2013). One benefit of using random forests together with elastic
nets is that random forests can detect non-linear associations
without having to specify the form of the association in advance.
The use of standardized interventions (as opposed to face-to-face
interventions that can have variable implementations) also facili-
tates these dose–response analyses.
There are several limitations of this study that should be noted.
First, future work predicting treatment response would benefit
from using larger samples, which would allow for more complex
models without overfitting. Although it would be ideal for future
work to also include highly dimensional data, such as neuroima-
ging, hormones, genetics, and microbiota, it would not be desir-
able to include those data at the cost of large sample size and
population diversity. In addition, without comparable data from
an alternative clinical intervention, we have no way of gauging
the extent to which this model is predicting response to
Deprexis specifically v. a response to interventions more generally.
We do not yet know whether the results of this model can be used
to recommend whether an individual should try Deprexis or not.
Finally, although Deprexis has been studied in other countries,
this was the first trial of the English version of Deprexis, and
many of the important predictors here were either not collected
or not applicable to prior European trials. Thus, testing our algo-
rithm with other Deprexis-treated samples was not possible.
Given that the goal of this project was to develop an algorithm
that could be used to predict response to a single treatment, one
might wonder how this work could be used in real-world clinical
settings. Imagine a clinical setting with a large waiting list (not an
unusual circumstance in some settings, such as treatment centers
at large medical centers or universities). Patient information could
be obtained, via an online survey or other methods, and fed into
the Deprexis treatment response algorithm. The algorithm may
predict several of these new patients will show significant
improvement in symptoms following Deprexis, whereas other
individuals are predicted to show relatively little symptom change.
As a result of these analyses, Deprexis could be provided right
away to the first set of individuals, perhaps allowing for the
patients predicted not to respond to Deprexis to be scheduled
sooner for more intensive, in-person treatment. Treatment cen-
ters would need to decide the threshold for an acceptable amount
of predicted change in order to receive Deprexis, and this could
potentially dynamically fluctuate depending on demand for ser-
vices, therapist availability, and other constraints. In addition,
while a patient’s future usage of the various modules is obviously
unknown prior to treatment, this aspect of the model could be
used to explore different usage scenarios and recommend
which modules are likely to yield the greatest return on an indi-
vidual patient’s time investment. To make this hypothetical appli-
cation more concrete, we provide case examples of predicted
response to treatment, using the machine learning algorithm
developed in this study, for two hypothetical patients under
two different usage scenarios in online Supplementary materials,
section 7.0.
This exercise demonstrates how some patients could be identi-
fied as good candidates for this low-intensity, Internet-based treat-
ment, whereas others may not be. Of course, because we have only
one treatment, we do not know how these participants might
respond to other treatments (or no treatment at all). Ideally, algo-
rithms could be developed for predicting response to different
treatments. These algorithms could then be used to determine
the optimal treatment(s) for a patient with a given set of attributes.
We believe methods used in the current study provide a small but
important step toward developing these algorithms and, given the
emphasis of machine learning methods for reducing overfitting
and increasing generalization to new samples, this may be a better
alternative than traditional statistical approaches typically used to
detect treatment predictors (for a review, see Cohen and
DeRubeis, 2018). With further refinement, ensemble machine
learning methods may facilitate a more efficient mental health
care system by helping clinicians optimize treatment delivery so
that patients initially receive the treatment with the best likelihood
of a positive response for that specific individual."
A machine learning model for predicting blood concentration of quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia and depression based on real-world data,"Aims: This study aimed to establish a prediction model of quetiapine concentration in patients with schizophrenia and depression, based on real-world data via machine learning techniques to assist clinical regimen decisions. Methods: A total of 650 cases of quetiapine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from 483 patients at the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University from 1 November 2019 to 31 August 2022 were included in the study. Univariate analysis and sequential forward selection (SFS) were implemented to screen the important variables influencing quetiapine TDM. After 10-fold cross validation, the algorithm with the optimal model performance was selected for predicting quetiapine TDM among nine models. SHapley Additive exPlanation was applied for model interpretation. Results: Four variables (daily dose of quetiapine, type of mental illness, sex and CYP2D6 competitive substrates) were selected through univariate analysis (P &lt;.05) and SFS to establish the models. The CatBoost algorithm with the best predictive ability (mean [SD] R2 = 0.63 ± 0.02, RMSE = 137.39 ± 10.56, MAE = 103.24 ± 7.23) was chosen for predicting quetiapine TDM among nine models. The mean (SD) accuracy of the predicted TDM within ±30% of the actual TDM was 49.46 ± 3.00%, and that of the recommended therapeutic range (200–750 ng mL_1) was 73.54 ± 8.3%. Compared with the PBPK model in a previous study, the CatBoost model shows slightly higher accuracy within ±100% of the actual value. Conclusions: This work is the first real-world study to predict the blood concentration of quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia and depression using artificial intelligent techniques, which is of significance and value for clinical medication guidance.  2023 The British Pharmacological Society.","In this study, we compared the prediction abilities of quetiapine trough concentrations by applying nine artificial intelligent techniques for patients with schizophrenia and depression. Ultimately, the CatBoost algorithm was selected to build the prediction model with mean (SD) R2 of 0.63_±_0.02, which achieved a good prediction accuracy in the absence of genetic information. This finding indicated that the CatBoost model has good predictive ability and can be used to predict the blood concentration of patients after taking quetiapine. We also used the SHAP method to interpret the outcome of the prediction model; SHAP values demonstrated the feature importance and direction of each variable and clarified the correlation between the target variable and the relevant important covariates, which is of great significance for the clinical medication guidance.

In recent years, there have not been many traditional PK models for predicting quetiapine concentration. We found one study that mentions a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of healthy adults receiving quetiapine with a single oral dose of 25_mg and multiple doses from 25_mg ascending to 300_mg.24 As reported in the study, 92% of the predicted concentrations are within a twofold error of the observed predictions, and nearly 60% are within a 1.25-fold error in the PBPK model.24 We compared the prediction accuracy between our model and the PBPK model and found that in the percentile of ±20% and ±30%, the prediction accuracy of our model is lower that the accuracy within a 1.25-fold error in the PBPK model (34.08_±_2.74%/49.46_±_3.00% vs. nearly 60%), but in the percentile of ±100%, the prediction accuracy of our model slightly outperforms the PBPK model (94.23_±_2.03% vs. 92%). Therefore, compared with the PBPK model, our model using machine learning has a slight advantage in prediction accuracy within ±100%, but weak performance in predicting TDM within ±20% and ±30% of the actual value. With increasing sample data input in the future, the machine learning model could achieve better prediction performance, and more comprehensive comparison with the traditional PK model should be generated.

The most commonly discussed variable influencing quetiapine concentration was dosage in previous studies. Several studies on psychotic disorders have identified dosage to affect quetiapine concentration. A review suggests that there is a weak inter-individual correlation between quetiapine dose and measured serum concentration (from trough samples).25 Albantakis et al. have also quantified the relationship between daily dose and serum concentration in children and adolescents with psychotic and mood disorders. They found a significant positive but weak linear relationship between the daily dose and serum concentration of quetiapine (from trough samples) in the total sample.26 Among the selected important variables in the prediction model in our study, the dosage was the most prominent influencing variable, and it was positively associated with quetiapine concentration, which was consistent with the previous studies.

Co-administration of two substrates of the same enzyme, or co-administration of a substrate with an inhibitor or an inducer, entails the possibility of a drug interaction. As a consequence, serum concentrations of the co-administered drugs may be increased or decreased, resulting in clinical toxicity or diminished therapeutic effect. Dosage adjustments may then be required to avoid adverse effects or therapeutic failure.3 So drug combinations (CYP3A4/CYP2D6 enzyme inducers and others) were also crucial variables we took into consideration initially. According to a Revised Consensus Guideline and Review by AGNP in 2017, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and ABCB1 are all involved in the metabolism of quetiapine into N-desalkyl quetiapine.11 Inhibitors or inducers of these liver drug enzymes and transporters can affect quetiapine and N-desalkyl quetiapine concentrations. Some show drug–drug interactions in previous research. Castberg et al have quantified the relationship between quetiapine and clozapine or fluvoxamine. They found that due to the increased serum levels of quetiapine, a lower dose than usual should be considered when quetiapine was administered to elderly patients and to patients co-medicated with clozapine or fluvoxamine. As the inducing effect of carbamazepine on quetiapine metabolism is very potent, co-treatment with carbamazepine cannot be recommended.27 In our research, we found that co-administration of two of the CYP2D6 enzyme competitive substrates resulted in increased quetiapine concentrations. However, some variables were excluded because of extremely uneven distribution, lots of missing values and missed opportunities to monitor the concentration changes (low frequency monitoring) when briefly combined with quetiapine, such as CYP3A4/CYP2D6 inhibitors and CYP3A4 enzyme competitive substrates, creating an illusion that these inhibitors did not affect quetiapine concentration. These variables may be more thoroughly studied in future research with a large number of samples.

In addition, we also found that patients with schizophrenia were treated with higher doses than patients with depression, which was consistent with the instructions for quetiapine. People with depression obtained a daily quetiapine dose within the recommended range of 150–300_mg per day, while people with schizophrenia were treated within the recommended range of 400–800_mg per day.

To date, the viewpoints about impacts of gender on quetiapine and its active moiety levels remain inconsistent. Some believe that gender was not a significant variable for quetiapine concentrations.28 Conversely, Castberg et al. stated that gender influenced the dose-adjusted concentrations of quetiapine, with females generally having higher dose-adjusted concentrations than males.29 The authors believed that there was an interaction between gender and age on dose-adjusted quetiapine concentration, and the differences between genders increased with age. In Castberg et al.'s study, they found that an 80-year-old woman had 33% higher dose-adjusted quetiapine concentration averagely than a man of the same age.29 Quetiapine is extensively metabolized in the liver. CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoenzyme involved in these metabolic reactions.29 The generally smaller size of the liver and the kidneys in females could possibly explain the difference. In addition, some studies indicate that oestradiol enhances CYP3A4 expression, and previous research has shown that the gender effect for quetiapine was not apparent before menopause but increased in post-menopausal women.30 One could speculate that this effect is related to the influence of oestrogen on CYP3A4 activity, although limited data exist to support such a hypothesis.

So far, no pharmacogenetic guideline has been published recommending a quetiapine dose adjustment based on the patient's genetic polymorphism. Moreover, despite some pharmacogenetic studies being published,31, 32 no consensus has been reached on the clinical relevance of such polymorphisms, that is, the effects on therapy effectiveness and safety. In the present study, due to the limited research conditions, exploration of cytochrome enzyme genotypes was not considered.

Machine learning algorithms used in this study, as a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, take advantage of large-scale complex algorithms and datasets to uncover useful patterns that can evaluate data-driven estimation when forecasting from multiple variables and obtain non-linear variable relations to deliver predicted clinical outcomes with high accuracy.33, 34 The rapidly developing machine learning has been widely applied in the biomedicine field, such as clinical diagnostics, precision treatments and health monitoring.35 The capacity of machine learning techniques have been shown in some previous studies. For instance, Huang et al. established a dose prediction model of vancomycin through XGBoost, which helps to deeply explore second-order variable interactions to enhance model performance.13 Compared with the traditional PK model and population PK analysis, machine learning is known for its self-organizational and learning capabilities, which enables computers to learn from ‘experience’ without being explicitly programmed.36, 37 In other words, the machine learning model can be updated through the automatic extraction of data from electronic health records and continuous monitoring of physiological data, which is an effective modelling method for real-world data.

The modelling algorithm used in this study, CatBoost, is an improvement over the standard gradient boosting algorithm, which can deal with classification features well.18 The advantages of CatBoost include the following: (1) CatBoost can use target statistics to deal with high-cardinality categorical variables with minimum information loss; (2) CatBoost has a unique calculation method of leaf value that can overcome gradient bias; and (3) CatBoost always uses a full binary tree with mirrored nodes to avoid model overfitting, increase model reliability and accelerate the prediction.38 One limitation of the CatBoost algorithm is that it shows better performance in handling categorical, heterogeneous data than other machine learning algorithms, but falls behind other techniques when facing homogeneous, numeric data.38 We can see that CatBoost is a good choice for modelling when data are heterogeneous and categorical.

5 LIMITATIONS
Although we developed a new method for TDM model selection and evaluated the method, this study had certain limitations. First, the sample size used in our model was small. The samples were collected from November 2019, because TDM has only been conducted since then. We included all eligible samples with TDM results for preliminary screening. As the final sample size was limited, it can be expected that more valid sample data will be required in the future to ensure a more robust model. Second, the TDM value of quetiapine varies greatly due to the large differences among individual patients, and the median (IQR) TDM value was 269.72 (141.60–451.30) ng_mL_1. If the predicted value deviates from the true value, the RMSE and MAE will be relatively large and the R2 will be relatively small, and the accuracy will be reduced. This study uses single-centre data for modelling, and the prediction effect will be better after the inclusion of multi-centre data in the future. Also, an external validation from different centres could be conducted in the analysis to verify the model generalization. Third, some variables were excluded because of extremely uneven distribution, lots of missing values and low-frequency monitoring of drug concentrations. These variables may be more thoroughly studied in future research with a large number of samples. Last, some relevant characteristics of patients (e.g. polymorphisms in CYP450) were not included due to limitations of the test items. Therefore, the study was confined to the drug concentration level.

6 CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to predict the blood concentration of quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia and depression using machine learning techniques. The CatBoost model was proven to have more promising prediction performance than other artificial intelligent models (mean [SD] R2 =_0.63_±_0.02, RMSE_=_137.39_±_10.56, MAE_=_103.24_±_7.23, accuracy of the predicted TDM within ±30% of the actual TDM was 49.46_±_3.00%), and the accuracy of the predicted TDM within ±30% of the recommended therapeutic range (200–750_ng_mL_1) was 73.54_±_8.30%. The most important variables influencing quetiapine TDM were the daily dose of quetiapine, CYP2D6 competitive substrates, type of mental illness and sex. Compared with the PBPK model in a previous study, the CatBoost model shows slightly higher accuracy within ±100% of the actual value. Our model was designed as a real-time assisting clinical decision support tool to help with the individualized dose adjustment of quetiapine, thus improving its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing its adverse effects. Therefore, our study fills the gap in this research field."
A mobile health application to predict postpartum depression based on machine learning,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a disorder that often goes undiagnosed. The development of a screening program requires considerable and careful effort, where evidence-based decisions have to be taken in order to obtain an effective test with a high level of sensitivity and an acceptable specificity that is quick to perform, easy to interpret, culturally sensitive, and cost-effective. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to develop classification models for detecting the risk of PPD during the first week after childbirth, thus enabling early intervention; and second, to develop a mobile health (m-health) application (app) for the Android® (Google, Mountain View, CA) platform based on the model with best performance for both mothers who have just given birth and clinicians who want to monitor their patient's test. Materials and Methods: A set of predictive models for estimating the risk of PPD was trained using machine learning techniques and data about postpartum women collected from seven Spanish hospitals. An internal evaluation was carried out using a hold-out strategy. An easy flowchart and architecture for designing the graphical user interface of the m-health app was followed. Results: Naive Bayes showed the best balance between sensitivity and specificity as a predictive model for PPD during the first week after delivery. It was integrated into the clinical decision support system for Android mobile apps. Conclusions: This approach can enable the early prediction and detection of PPD because it fulfills the conditions of an effective screening test with a high level of sensitivity and specificity that is quick to perform, easy to interpret, culturally sensitive, and cost-effective.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","The main contribution of this work is the development of a CDSS in the Android platform that is able to classify through a simple questionnaire if a mother who had just given birth is at risk of developing a PPD episode during the first week, enabling an early intervention.

A database containing socioeconomic parameters, clinical data, and psychiatric questionnaires scores from 1,397 patients was used. After analyzing the information and the application of a data mining methodology for the development, validation, and evaluation of different classification models, we show that the naive Bayes model had the best performance, with balanced sensitivity and specificity close to 0.73. Questions about independent variables used at the classification models can be answered by mothers during the first week after delivery.

It was designed and developed an m-health clinical decision support app for the Android platform integrating the naive Bayes model, which showed the best performance among those evaluated during this work. This mobile app can be used by both mothers who have just given birth as well as clinicians who want to monitor their patient's test. After the user answers all the test questions, the classification as belonging or not to a population at risk of PPD is displayed in a clear and understandable way.

As expected, inasmuch as only 11 of the 16 variables used by Tortajada et al.14 were also used in this work, our classification performance is not as high as theirs. However, a reasonable accuracy was achieved apart from ours being an inexpensive and easy-to-answer test that can be answered during the first week after birth on most Android mobile devices, offering verified results. This is linked with the idea of an effective and cost-efficient screening as it would allow, through the answering of a few simple questions, for the identification of possible PPD cases that would otherwise remain undiagnosed. It has been shown that is possible to put in clinicians' and patients' hands a tool that helps to prevent the disease as well as to detect the population at risk.

In this study, the proposed models have achieved an estimation of parameters and an internal validation in the study population. Future works should include an external validation of the final model based on a prospective cohort study and an impact analysis of the models.36 This would require checking the difference of PPD appearance among mothers who answer our questionnaire and after a positive result are treated by clinicians and those who are not. Regarding the Android app, it would be possible to get useful information on the appearance of PPD after a few months following childbirth in order to create new classifiers because mobile apps provide easy ways to obtain user feedback. Besides, it would be useful to allow sending the results to other analysis or storage apps because the current version of the app only shows the results to the final user on the screen. Regarding classification models that were not used during this study, it would be interesting to check Bayesian networks because these can also deal with missing data, find probabilistic dependencies, and present a good performance.37"
Assessment and Prediction of Depression and Anxiety Risk Factors in Schoolchildren: Machine Learning Techniques Performance Analysis,"Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms in early childhood have a major effect on children's mental health growth and cognitive development. The effect of mental health problems on cognitive development has been studied by researchers for the last 2 decades. Objective: In this paper, we sought to use machine learning techniques to predict the risk factors associated with schoolchildren's depression and anxiety. Methods: The study sample consisted of 3984 students in fifth to ninth grades, aged 10-15 years, studying at public and refugee schools in the West Bank. The data were collected using the health behaviors schoolchildren questionnaire in the 2013-2014 academic year and analyzed using machine learning to predict the risk factors associated with student mental health symptoms. We used 5 machine learning techniques (random forest [RF], neural network, decision tree, support vector machine [SVM], and naive Bayes) for prediction. Results: The results indicated that the SVM and RF models had the highest accuracy levels for depression (SVM: 92.5%; RF: 76.4%) and anxiety (SVM: 92.4%; RF: 78.6%). Thus, the SVM and RF models had the best performance in classifying and predicting the students' depression and anxiety. The results showed that school violence and bullying, home violence, academic performance, and family income were the most important factors affecting the depression and anxiety scales. Conclusions: Overall, machine learning proved to be an efficient tool for identifying and predicting the associated factors that influence student depression and anxiety. The machine learning techniques seem to be a good model for predicting abnormal depression and anxiety symptoms among schoolchildren, so the deployment of machine learning within the school information systems might facilitate the development of health prevention and intervention programs that will enhance students'mental health and cognitive development.

In this study, we used ML models in predicting depression and anxiety symptoms among schoolchildren. The study found that two-thirds of students reported moderate depression symptoms and about 7% had severe depression, whereas around 22% of students reported moderate and severe anxiety symptoms. The data showed that students in the sixth, eighth, and ninth grades had higher depression symptoms, whereas students in the fifth and sixth grades reported higher anxiety symptoms. These results are consistent with similar studies that found high depression and anxiety rates among adolescents [4,15,38-40]. The severe depression level of our study was close to those reported among schoolchildren in Germany, Canada, and Jordan [14,39,41]. The severe anxiety level was consistent with the results reported among adolescents living in Jordan, Spain, Canada, and Saudi Arabia [38,39,41,42].

The performance of the ML algorithms in predicting schoolchildren’s depression and anxiety was assessed using the AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score performance measures. In total, 23 relevant features were used after performing feature selection using ML algorithms. The features were used as input variables, whereas the average depression and anxiety scores were considered as the target variables independently. Among the tested models, SVM and RF showed the best performance results for depression (SVM: 92.5%; RF: 76.4%) and anxiety (SVM: 92.4%; RF: 78.6%). Furthermore, the specificity for the SVM and RF models were 87.8% and 88.6% for depression, respectively, and 76.9% and 85.5% for anxiety, respectively. Of the 23 features selected, 16 features were correlated to instances of depression and anxiety, including physical, mental, and social health indicators. However, the other models showed acceptable performance scores in predicting depression and anxiety. Thus, the findings of our study are consistent with other studies that assessed ML models in predicting depression and anxiety among adolescents and adults [4,6,17,43-48]. In Priya et al [4], the NB model had the highest accuracy levels for anxiety, depression, and stress, whereas the F1-score showed that the RF model had the highest performance measure for stress symptoms. Furthermore, the results are consistent with other studies that assessed the ML models in predicting depression and anxiety among adults [44-46]. The studies showed that the ML models are efficient in predicting depression and anxiety symptoms.

Significant risk factors for schoolchildren’s depression and anxiety were found. Poor family and school conditions, such as low levels of school and family support, home and school violence (bullying behaviors), and low levels of positive health perception were highly significant to the risk of suffering from severe and moderate depression and anxiety, mainly among boys. This has been observed through the implementation of ML models. Additionally, the same results were obtained when controlling and not controlling for school type, age, and place of residence.

Furthermore, the data have shown that health-associated factors also had a significant effect on students’ growth, cognitive development, and academic performance [49]. Moreover, it has been found that negative health conditions, such as obesity and PTSD, had a direct negative impact on student's mental health and cognitive development. Conversely, mother’s education, gender, age, locality, physical activity, and good nutrition had less significant effects on mental health issues than the abovementioned variables.

These findings are consistent with other related studies that have found a strong association between mental health problems and risk factors such as school and home violence or negative health conditions [3,43,50,51]. Similar to previous studies, the research has shown that specific conditions such as obesity and PTSD are significantly correlated to depression and anxiety [5,26,52]. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy results obtained from the implemented ML algorithms are equivalent to the prediction accuracy rates obtained from related studies in the fields of mental health, as the RF model proved to be the most significantly accurate model [4,53].

Moreover, this study shows that several ML algorithms can predict depression and anxiety and their associated risk factors. The used algorithms successfully managed to predict the target variables, and the NB algorithm had the lowest accuracy rate for both anxiety and depression. However, it could be considered for the prediction of mental health conditions among schoolchildren with the presented variables. The RF ML model, on the other hand, proved the most effective in predicting depression and anxiety when students’ health (physical and social) and related risk factors are considered. Overall, the classification accuracies were all at a favorable level. These findings show the importance of integrating ML techniques in the fields of mental health. These findings are consistent with other studies that indicated the importance of using ML in psychiatric and mental health diagnosis [4,54,55]. In the study of Haque et al [56], the RF model reported the highest accuracy among other ML algorithms (RF, XGBoost, and DT) in detecting depression among children aged 4-17 years. Furthermore, Sau et al [57] assessed 5 ML algorithms (logistic regression, NB, RF, SVM, and CatBoost) in identifying risk factors associated with anxiety symptoms, with the CatBoost model reporting the highest accuracy among the other ML models.

In this study, the risk features importance rating for anxiety and depression was estimated, which showed that age, bullying behaviors, PTSD, life satisfaction, and anxiety are the 5 most important features in predicting depression symptoms, whereas psychosomatic symptoms, age, bullying behaviors, and depression symptoms are the most important features in predicting anxiety symptoms. The study findings are consistent with other studies that found that the children’s age, academic score, family income, social and family support, school and home violence, and physical activities are significant and important factors in predicting schoolchildren’s depression and anxiety [13,15]. An important contribution of this study is the classification of schoolchildren at high risk to develop anxiety and depression symptoms. The most important features in our model are consistent with previous studies, which found that the population with high risks of anxiety and depression has a higher rate of tobacco use, increased BMI, and decreased academic performance [21,58-60].

Strengths and Limitations
Currently, the standard mental assessment scales are used in detecting schoolchildren’s depression and anxiety, and it is mainly based on the health care system screening programs, which are mainly used when abnormal symptoms are witnessed. Furthermore, the current practices might fail in detecting the main associated factors with a subsequent delay in detection and intervention. Our prediction model combined the different levels of risk factors, including physical, mental, and sociodemographic factors. Our model is less dependent on the schoolchildren’s subjective awareness of health status and health care screening behaviors; thus, the model improved the automatic and early detection of schoolchildren’s depression and anxiety.

Overall, our study strengthens the need for the implementation and deployment of ML in addressing mental health problems. The early detection and prediction of risk factors associated with mental health symptoms (depression and anxiety) can enhance the development of intervention and prevention programs that improve children’s growth and cognitive development. Thus, this research study not only introduces the ML techniques in predicting depression and anxiety but also provides the policy makers with the power of ML in the early prediction and diagnosis of schoolchildren’s mental health problems.

The study is limited by the number of variables. Based on the findings presented in this paper, future research will benefit from expanding the study by adding additional associated factors, including cognitive development skills, in-school student behavior, social activities, and digital media activities. Furthermore, variables related to external factors, such as the incidence of violence in the community, presence of soldiers, checkpoints, and mobility restrictions are not present in this study, yet these variables would be very relevant to further investigate the risk factors associated with anxiety and depression among schoolchildren in the Palestinian context. The presence of these variables would further enhance the accuracy of the ML prediction models for anxiety and depression.

Conclusions
The study assessed the accuracy and performance of 5 ML models in predicting the associated health factors on Palestinian schoolchildren’s depression and anxiety. Based on the results presented, this research concludes that ML algorithms, particularly (but not exclusively) RF and neural network, are effective predictive models for students’ mental health status. These models could be integrated into schools’ information systems for the automatic prediction of students’ depression and anxiety based on key features. In this manner, students, families, school staff, and administration will be able to tackle issues that might affect students’ mental health using the obtained prediction results. Likewise, by making use of accurate ML techniques, such as RF, public health professionals, health care providers, and decision makers will be able to predict rising issues and implement relevant intervention programs to enhance students’ health, education, and well-being."
Breast Cancer Patients' Depression Prediction by Machine Learning Approach,"One of the most common cancer in females is breasts cancer. This cancer can has high impact on the women including health and social dimensions. One of the most common social dimension is depression caused by breast cancer. Depression can impairs life quality. Depression is one of the symptom among the breast cancer patients. One of the solution is to eliminate the depression in breast cancer patients is by treatments but these treatments can has different unpredictable impacts on the patients. Therefore it is suitable to develop algorithm in order to predict the depression range.  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","In this section, performance results of the ELM predictive model are reported for depression range prediction in breast cancer patients. Figure 1(a) presents the accuracy of the developed ELM predictive model for depression range. Figure 1(b) presents the accuracy of the developed ANN predictive model for depression range. Figure 1(c) presents the accuracy of the developed fuzzy predictive model for depression range. The prediction accuracy of the ELM model is acceptable for this data. It can be seen that most of the points fall along the diagonal line. It follows that the prediction results are in very good agreement with the measured values for the ELM method. This observation can be confirmed with acceptable value for the coefficient of determination. The number of overestimated or underestimated values is limited. Consequently, it is obvious that the predicted values enjoy high level of precision. It can be observed better accuracy of the depression range prediction is for ELM approach than ANN approach.

Results of the depression of breast cancer patients' prediction by machine learning approached are presented in Figure 1. Three machine learning methods were implemented and results can be analyzed. RMSE values of the predictions are:

    0.8533 for ANN with extreme learning algorithm

    0.9492 for ANN with back propagation learning algorithm

    1.0155 for fuzzy with genetic algorithm

Based on the presented results one can note the highest prediction accuracy with ANN with extreme learning algorithm. The lowest prediction accuracy was observed for fuzzy with genetic algorithm."
Comparing resting state and task-based EEG using machine learning to predict vulnerability to depression in a non-clinical population,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) affects a large portion of the population and levies a huge societal burden. It has serious consequences like decreased productivity and reduced quality of life, hence there is considerable interest in understanding and predicting it. As it is a mental disorder, neural measures like EEG are used to study and understand its underlying mechanisms. However most of these studies have either explored resting state EEG (rs-EEG) data or task-based EEG data but not both, we seek to compare their respective efficacy. We work with data from non-clinically depressed individuals who score higher and lower on the depression scale and hence are more and less vulnerable to depression, respectively. Forty participants volunteered for the study. Questionnaires and EEG data were collected from participants. We found that people who are more vulnerable to depression had on average increased EEG amplitude in the left frontal channel, and decreased amplitude in the right frontal and occipital channels for raw data (rs-EEG). Task-based EEG data from a sustained attention to response task used to measure spontaneous thinking, an increased EEG amplitude in the central part of the brain for individuals with low vulnerability and an increased EEG amplitude in right temporal, occipital and parietal regions in individuals more vulnerable to depression were found. In an attempt to predict vulnerability (high/low) to depression, we found that a Long Short Term Memory model gave the maximum accuracy of 91.42% in delta wave for task-based data whereas 1D-Convolution neural network gave the maximum accuracy of 98.06% corresponding to raw rs-EEG data. Hence if one has to look at the primary question of which data will be good for predicting vulnerability to depression, rs-EEG seems to be better than task-based EEG data. However, if mechanisms driving depression like rumination or stickiness are to be understood, task-based data may be more effective. Furthermore, as there is no consensus as to which biomarker of rs-EEG is more effective in the detection of MDD, we also experimented with evolutionary algorithms to find the most informative subset of these biomarkers. Higuchi fractal dimension, phase lag index, correlation and coherence features were also found to be the most important features for predicting vulnerability to depression using rs-EEG. These findings bring up new possibilities for EEG-based machine/deep learning diagnostics in the future.  2023, The Author(s).","
Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders that alters the lives of people and levies a huge burden on society. Even though its treatment is available49, difficulty in detecting it and the high chances of relapse make it challenging to get rid of it. A lot of research has been done to understand and detect the disorder by finding relevant biomarkers or using machine learning to automatically detect relevant patterns and thus segregate the data into healthy and depressed individuals. Most of the studies have used rs-EEG data or task-based EEG to this effect but not both. In this study, the main question that we focused on is comparing the efficacy of rs-EEG and task-based EEG to differentiate people who are more vulnerable to depression from those who are not. We seek to find a subset of depression markers (rs-EEG) that are more relevant in differentiating between these groups of participants.

Comparing the analysis between rs-EEG and task-based data it was found that the maximum classification accuracy for task-based data (91.42%) is lower than the maximum accuracy obtained from rs-EEG data (98.06%). Hence if one has to look at the primary question of which data will be good for predicting vulnerability to depression, rs-EEG seems to be better than task-based EEG data. However, if one has to understand the mechanisms driving depression, like rumination or stickiness, then task-based data will be more effective.

We found that people who are more vulnerable to depression had, on average, increased activity in the left frontal channel, and decreased activity in the right frontal and occipital channels for raw data (rs-EEG). There is also a high number of electrodes that were found to be statistically significant in differentiating the two groups and amongst the brain waves only delta 0.5–4Hz was found to have significant differences between the two groups. These findings are at odds with most of the studies done with clinically depressed individuals who find theta and low alpha waves to be of more significance50. However, there are also a few studies that found delta to be an important contender that showed differences in depressed individuals51,52. We found that correlation (raw, delta), coherence (delta, gamma), PLI (raw, delta, and gamma), PLV (raw, delta), and HFD (alpha, delta, and theta) features had electrodes with statistically significant differences between individuals with high and low vulnerability to depression. Various studies have reported HFD in alpha53,54, coherence in gamma55, PLI for alpha56, and PLV for beta bands57 as important features. This shows that some biomarkers for depression can be information for vulnerability to depression. On the other hand, biomarkers like DFA, relative gamma power, and alpha asymmetry have been reported as useful by some studies but they did not show any significance in our study. As there exist a lot of depression biomarkers, we used three evolutionary algorithms to determine the most relevant feature subset that can classify if a data sample was from an individual with high or low vulnerability to the depression group. We found HFD, PLI, correlation and coherence features are the most important features. GWO gave the maximum accuracy of 82.75% with HFD and coherence features which is an improvement over the genetic algorithm and PSO. This not only suggests that depression biomarkers can be used for the classification of individuals prone to depression but also indicates that a couple of biomarkers can be used to approach good classification accuracy. If a machine learning model was to be used for this task in real life the model will not have high computation needs.

Since power spectrum values differed from other biomarkers (which had one value per subject), they were used for classification separately. The classification results were corroborated by statistical analysis, which also showed that raw and delta oscillation has the most predictive power. It was found that the 1D-CNN classifier was best at predicting the instances of rs-EEG from individuals more and less vulnerable to depression. It obtained an accuracy of 98% and 94.45% in the raw and delta brain wave respectively. 1D-CNNs have been proven to work very well for predicting time-series data. This reinforces the idea that LSTMs are suitable for similar problems. One thing to note is though the other brain waves perform above chance level, they perform very poorly as compared to delta brain waves.

Entanglement of various factors like age, gender, culture, socio-economic status, education level, etc., in the manifestation and maintenance of depression, makes detection and treatment even more challenging. However, rumination is a core symptom of depression that has been found to generalize across populations. Though rs-EEG is easier to collect than any task-based EEG data, it is possible that task-based data might give more generalizable results. Keeping this perspective in mind we also analyzed “stickiness” data which is a measure of rumination. The statistical test showed that raw, delta and theta brain waves have channels that are statistically different between individuals with high and low vulnerability to depression. Machine learning analysis revealed that BLSTM gave the maximum classification accuracy of 91% for delta brain waves.

However, we should keep in mind that we worked with a limited sample size of forty participants. Further studies with a larger sample size need to be done to corroborate these findings for generalization to a wider population.

Conclusion
With this study, we tried to draw a comparison between the efficacy of using task-based EEG data vs rs-EEG data for predicting the vulnerability to depression in individuals. It was found that individuals more vulnerable to depression had on average increased activity in the right temporal channel, and decreased activity in the left fronto-central and right occipital channels for raw rs-EEG data. Task-based data showed increased activity in the central part of the brain for individuals with low vulnerability and increased activity in the right temporal, occipital and parietal regions in individuals more vulnerable to depression. It was also found that coherence, PLI, correlation and HFD might be the key biomarkers (rs-EEG) for differentiating the two groups. Though raw rs-EEG data gave higher accuracy (98.06%) than 91.42% for delta waves in task-based data, the performance of classifiers was higher for task-based data across theta, alpha, beta and gamma brain waves. These results open up further avenues for future diagnostics aided by EEG using machine/deep learning."
Comparison of three machine learning models to predict suicidal ideation and depression among Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Machine learning (ML) algorithms based on various clinicodemographic, psychometric, and biographic factors have been used to predict depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt in adolescents, but there is still a need for more accurate and efficient models for screening the general adolescent population. In this study, we compared various ML methods to identify a model that most accurately predicts suicidal ideation and level of depression in a large cohort of school-aged adolescents. Methods: Ten psychological scale scores and 20 sociodemographic parameters were collected from 10,243 Chinese adolescents in the first or second year of middle school and high school. These variables were then included in a random forest (RF) model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and decision tree model for factor screening, dichotomous prediction of suicidal ideation (yes/no), and trichotomous prediction of depression (no depression, mild-moderate depression, or major depression). Results: The RF model demonstrated greater accuracy for predicting suicidal ideation (mean accuracy (ACC) = 87.3 %, SD = 3.2 %, area under curve (AUC) = 92.4 %) and depressive status (ACC = 84.0 %, SD = 2.8 %, AUC = 90.1 %) than SVM and decision tree models. We have also used the RF model to predict adolescents with both depression and suicidal ideation with satisfactory results. Significant differences were found in several sociodemographic parameters and scale scores among classification groups and differences in six factors between sexes. Conclusions: This RF model may prove valuable for predicting suicidal ideation, depression, and non-suicidal self-injury among the general population of Chinese adolescents.  2022","Adolescent suicide is a major public health concern globally, and rates are particularly high in China. It is therefore critical to develop screening instruments that can identify subjects at high risk from the general population for timely intervention. To this end, we established random forest, support vector machine, and decision tree learning models incorporating comprehensive psychological test results and sociodemographic information to predict suicidal ideation and depression in a large cohort of Chinese adolescents. Indirect comparisons, the random forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy for distinguishing adolescents with suicidal ideation and depression. Further, these models identified multiple factors differing among classification groups, as well as between males and females. These distinguishing factors may be valuable markers of suicide risk and aid in the development of individually targeted interventions.

Several previous studies have also reported that RF models outperform other ML model types for prediction of depression and suicide risk. Futoma et al. (2015) reported that a RF model and penalized logistic regression analysis were superior to other model types as indicated by higher average AUC (AUC = 0.684). Similarly, the RF model of Shen et al. (2020) yielded an average sensitivity of 73 % for prediction of suicide risk among college students while the model of Jung et al. (2019) yielded 77.8 % accuracy for predicting suicide risk among Korean adolescents, roughly equivalent to a XGBoost model (79 %). Differences in classification accuracy among these RF models may stem from inclusion of different sociodemographic variables and psychological scales, data preprocessing techniques, and sample sizes. In contrast, however, Aladag et al. (2018) reported that logistic regression and SVM classifiers yielded better predictive performance, possibly because they differentiated suicidal and nonsuicidal forum posts using text mining methods rather than by analysis of objective psychological test results. In the current study, RF model performance did not decline when incorporating only the top eight factors (those with greatest weight for prediction), underscoring the robustness of the model.

Of the top 8 predictors of suicidal ideation and of depression in adolescents, 5 were shared, and the first 8 predictors of adolescent suicidal ideation in the censored SDS were identical to the co-predictors. For instance, participant MAP-SR scale score ranked third for both suicidal ideation and depression prediction, ranked second in the common prediction. In general, depression-related factors such as MAP-SR are important predictors of suicidal ideation (Su et al., 2020). The high weight of the MAP-SR score is also consistent with the lack of social pleasure and social intimacy frequently reported in depression (Llerena et al., 2013). To our best knowledge, this is the first report showing that anhedonia can be a highly ranked factor in multi-factor forecasting. We suggest that lack of pleasure has a pervasive mediating effect on suicidal ideation and depression. In addition to MAP-SR, the SSS scale score ranked in the top five for both suicidal ideation and depression prediction. According to a systematic review by Gariepy et al. (2016), 84 % of all studies on childhood and adolescent depression have found a significant association between social support and protection from depression. In the current study, however, Subjective Support, Objective Support, and Support Utilization Degree were not strong predictors. It is possible that the weight of each factor is relatively small, while the social support scale is stronger as it summarizes the weights of multiple sub-factors. Non-suicidal self-harm behavior and maternal relationship status are also implicated in depression and suicidal ideation, but in this study the correlation between NSSI and suicidal ideation did not reach statistical significance. The correlation coefficients of NSSI with suicidal ideation and depression were 0.124 and 0.156 respectively. Next in importance was emotional neglect, which has a damaging effect on mental health throughout life, but it is rarely associated with mental illness in adolescence (Naughton et al., 2017), in contrast to physical and verbal abuse (Norman et al., 2012). We found that EN had the greatest influence on suicidal ideation and depression in adolescents, which underscores the importance of programs to deal with emotional neglect as well as actual abuse.

The degree of depression was the strongest contributor to adolescent suicidal ideation among the 45 factors included in the models. The strong influence of depressive state on suicidal ideation can also be seen in the decision tree diagram. In contrast to Shen et al. (2020), we found that suicidal ideation is a stronger predictor of depression than suicide planning. Consistent with Hawton et al. (2013), suicidal ideation was the strongest predictor of depression, with both positive and negative ideation ranked in the top 4 contributors. Further, the consistency of factor strength across depressive states suggests that different depressive states still have common characteristics. While these findings do not prove that suicidal ideation causes depression (or vice versa) in adolescents, they may help clinicians develop more effective interventions. Another conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that domestic violence appears to be a stronger predictor and possible driver of suicidal ideation and depression than experience of violence outside the home. The influences of the school environment and other intimate connections have yet to be included in longitudinal intimacy research, which have focused primarily on parental influences.

The 6 gender differences found in predictor strength may also aid in the development of more targeted youth suicide risk prevention programs. Since we had a large number of sociodemographic questions and each question had a small weight, we regarding them as one factor. Gender differences in demographic factors were also found in the longitudinal study of suicide risk in children and adolescents by Su et al. (2020). In that study, females exhibit higher frequencies of both suicidal ideation (31.60 % vs. 22.13 %) and depression (43.61 % vs. 35.47 %). also found higher suicidal ideation and depression rates in females. In the current study, we found a greater influence of childhood trauma on suicidal ideation in males, while suicidal ideation in females was more strongly influenced by social support. These results suggest that social factors as well as biological differences may account for the higher rates of suicidal ideation and depression in females.

The RF model developed here permits large-scale screening of adolescents at risk for suicide and depression in the general population, thereby facilitating timely targeted interventions. While adolescent suicide and depression are subject to intensive investigation, most studies have focused on causal mechanisms such as mediating effects or the efficacy of various treatment approaches. To promote wider applicability of this model, we must develop faster methods for collecting sociodemographic information and more concise psychometric scales (i.e., including items most informative about suicide and depression risks). For suicidal ideation, which is highly susceptible to change over time due to external circumstances, multiple testing is required. Therefore, more efficient data processing methods are also needed as well as additional research on the factors dynamically influencing the mental state of young people. An ultimate goal is establishment of a “Smart Campus” with a psychological treatment system to routinely detect suicidal ideation and depression in the school setting.

5. Limitations
In recent years, there has been little improvement in the sensitivity of RF models. Therefore, new algorithms may be required to further increase the model's predictive accuracy, thereby allowing more effective screening of adolescent depression and suicide. Although anxiety is a reliable predictor of suicidal ideation and depression, we did not consider anxiety as a factor when designing the survey.

6. Conclusions
We compared three machine learning models to identify risk factors predictive of suicidal ideation and depression levels among adolescents in the general population. The RF model outperformed decision tree and SVM models for prediction. The strongest psychological factors influencing suicidal ideation and depression were anhedonia, lack of social support, relationship with the mother, emotional neglect during childhood, and NSSI, so therapies should target these problems in adolescents for suicide and depression prevention. In addition, we identified several risk factors differing significantly in strength between males and females, again providing additional information for the development of individually tailored interventions for the prevention of suicide and depression among adolescents."
Cross-trial prediction of depression remission using problem-solving therapy: A machine learning approach,"Background: Psychotherapy is a standard depression treatment; however, determining a patient's prognosis with therapy relies on clinical judgment that is subject to trial-and-error and provider variability. Purpose: To develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict depression remission for patients undergoing 6 months of problem-solving therapy (PST). Method: Using data from the treatment arm of 2 randomized trials, ML models were trained and validated on ENGAGE-2 (ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT03841682) and tested on RAINBOW (ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT02246413) for predictions at baseline and at 2-months. Primary outcome was depression remission using the Depression Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) score < 0.5 at 6 months. Predictor variables included baseline characteristics (sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, psychosocial) and intervention engagement through 2-months. Results: Of the 26 candidate variables, 8 for baseline and 11 for 2-months were predictive of depression remission, and used to train the models. The best-performing model predicted remission with an accuracy significantly greater than chance in internal validation using the ENGAGE-2 cohort, at baseline [72.6% (SD = 3.6%), p < 0.0001] and at 2-months [72.3% (5.1%), p < 0.0001], and in external validation with the RAINBOW cohort at baseline [58.3% (0%), p < 0.0001] and at 2-months [62.3% (0%), p < 0.0001]. Model-agnostic explanations highlighted key predictors of depression remission at the cohort and patient levels, including female sex, lower self-reported sleep disturbance, lower sleep-related impairment, and lower negative problem orientation. Conclusions: ML models using clinical and patient-reported data can predict depression remission for patients undergoing PST, affording opportunities for prospective identification of likely responders, and for developing personalized early treatment optimization along the patient care trajectory.  2022 Elsevier B.V.","In this study, an SVM-based model predicted depression remission over 6 months among patients who received a PST-based psychosocial intervention. The model's internal testing accuracy was 72%; the accuracy was 62% when tested on an independent, hold-out dataset from a clinical trial that overlapped considerably in eligibility criteria and intervention design, but enrolled a geographically and socioeconomically different sample. The prediction accuracy improved from baseline with the addition of early treatment engagement data, highlighting its ability to incorporate additional features to assess patient progress as early as the first 2 months. The model prediction accuracy was significantly higher than chance, allowing for viable predictions regarding remission both prior to treatment and in the early phase of treatment, affording the possibility of continuous treatment optimization for individual patients during their care trajectory. In addition, the model-agnostic explanations provided face validity, highlighting the known risk factors contributing towards non-remission among selected patients (e.g., sleep disturbance).

After several decades of research on psychotherapy for depression (Cuijpers et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019; Driessen et al., 2016; Lemmens et al., 2020), the pragmatic question “what therapy works for whom,” remains poorly understood. In clinical settings, such psychotherapy decisions are often driven by trial-and-error, relying sometimes on findings from population-based estimates from clinical trials (e.g., baseline depression severity) or based on clinical intuition and judgment. Although previous systematic reviews have suggested the remission among patients undergoing PST to be around 49% [95%CI (30–68%)] (Cuijpers et al., 2014), it is difficult to predict a prospective patient's potential success in remission before treatment or during initial treatment. The use of ML techniques and associated model explanation offers new opportunities of patient-centered and data-driven therapeutic decisions, aligned with PM principles, in helping to identify which therapies would likely work for which patients. For example, the ability to predict whether PST can work for a specific patient at the point-of-care can help clinicians make decisions regarding the use of PST regimen for a specific patient. The progress of this patient can then be further evaluated at the 2-month visit using the model to further assess the remission success at 6-months. In other words, the PST ML model, trained on a sample of depression patients, can potentially be used on “unseen” patients at the point-of-care aiding in clinical decision making regarding the use of PST. Appropriate treatment selection can have useful implications for limiting ineffective first-line treatments, reducing economic and mental disabilities in patients, and improving the allocation of scarce resources for patients most likely to benefit from a chosen intervention (Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018).

The best-performing model (i.e., SVM) from this study can be applied to prospective patients (in an independent sample) for assessing their likelihood of remission with better than 60% accuracy. In addition, model explanation techniques can be used to ascertain factors that affect a patient's success with planned psychotherapy, allowing the physician to engage in shared decision making regarding planned therapy (Stiggelbout et al., 2012). For example, a patient's current sleep disturbance may be a key contributor to their predicted lack of remission; such patients can be engaged in preventive or combination treatment to optimize their chances of therapeutic success.

More importantly, the availability of clinical decision support tools opens opportunities for shared decision making between clinicians and patients, a key component of successful treatment selection (Cohen and DeRubeis, 2018). Advances in clinical decision support using the Electronic Health Record (EHR) can be utilized to trigger alerts for patients with matching criteria for an intervention, allowing the healthcare provider to review and discuss with the patients at the point-of-care, helping providers and patients make more informed treatment decisions (Kwan et al., 2020). The incorporation of the models developed in this study into real-world EHRs is plausible because of the relative simplicity of the model and the ability to generate model explanations to provide viable decision support for clinicians (Mane et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2015). SVM-based models with explanation tools do not have some of the challenges of mistrust as model predictions with “black box” algorithms that provide limited transparency and have challenges for pragmatic implementation in healthcare settings (Vollmer et al., 2020). However, additional challenges such as incorporating into workflow, usability, user acceptance, and adoption require further investigation (Beede et al., 2020).

Few studies have applied ML models for predicting the success of psychotherapies (Klumpp et al., 2020); model performance in this study was better than comparable depression prediction models for antidepressant therapy using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based biomarkers (Leuchter et al., 2010) and from using patient-reported data (Chekroud et al., 2016). As opposed to neurobiological measurements (e.g., EEG), the ML approach utilized patient-reported outcomes, socio-demographic and clinical information, making it inexpensive, accessible and implementable in routine practice for clinical decision support.
4.1. Limitations

This study has several limitations. The developed models used a relatively small training sample with shallow ML models relying on easily available patient-reported and clinical data. These models, however, were both internally and externally validated, and had reasonable performance, highlighting its potential for further translational evaluation within clinical systems. This study took a pragmatic approach focusing on features that can be readily translated into routine clinical settings; as such, easily available data such as self-reports and clinical data were only used. Future research should examine the model performance including additional clinical and behavioral variables, clinical notes from the EHR, and biological data such as genetic information and neuroimaging, and evaluate possible improvements in prediction accuracy against the feasibility and cost of data collection in routine clinical settings and the value added in clinical decision-making. The model predictions were developed for depression remission with PST only, without comparisons to the control group or other psychosocial interventions, or to clinical predictions by humans (using the same data). Although both clinical trials utilized the same eligibility criteria, the cohorts were from geographically, and socio-demographically different regions. This may have influenced the cross-validation findings of the ML models."
Cross-trial prediction of treatment outcome in depression: A machine learning approach,"Background: Antidepressant treatment efficacy is low, but might be improved by matching patients to interventions. At present, clinicians have no empirically validated mechanisms to assess whether a patient with depression will respond to a specific antidepressant. We aimed to develop an algorithm to assess whether patients will achieve symptomatic remission from a 12-week course of citalopram. Methods: We used patient-reported data from patients with depression (n=4041, with 1949 completers) from level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D; ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00021528) to identify variables that were most predictive of treatment outcome, and used these variables to train a machine-learning model to predict clinical remission. We externally validated the model in the escitalopram treatment group (n=151) of an independent clinical trial (Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Outcomes [COMED]; ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00590863). Findings: We identified 25 variables that were most predictive of treatment outcome from 164 patient-reportable variables, and used these to train the model. The model was internally cross-validated, and predicted outcomes in the STAR*D cohort with accuracy significantly above chance (64·6% [SD 3·2]; p<0·0001). The model was externally validated in the escitalopram treatment group (N=151) of COMED (accuracy 59·6%, p=0.043). The model also performed significantly above chance in a combined escitalopram-buproprion treatment group in COMED (n=134; accuracy 59·7%, p=0·023), but not in a combined venlafaxine-mirtazapine group (n=140; accuracy 51·4%, p=0·53), suggesting specificity of the model to underlying mechanisms. Interpretation: Building statistical models by mining existing clinical trial data can enable prospective identification of patients who are likely to respond to a specific antidepressant.  2016 Elsevier Ltd.","We developed a model to predict symptomatic remission after taking citalopram, a common antidepressant, with clinical rating data. Our model performance is similar to that of calculators of disease risk, recurrence, or treatment response in various areas of medicine, including oncology and cardiovascular disease.34, 35, 36, 37 In the context of depression, the model performs comparably to the best available biomarker—an EEG-based index38, 39—but is less expensive, easier to implement, and validated in large internal and external clinical trial samples (a direct comparison is not possible owing to the different patient samples). The model was optimised to detect future responders, and improved substantially if a self-reported measure of overall depressive severity after 2 weeks of treatment was included in the model, indicating the possible usefulness of a 2-week prediction update (appendix).

A personalised medicine approach to pharmacotherapy holds promise in treatment of depression, a highly heterogeneous illness40 for which no single treatment is universally effective, and for which many patients undergo several treatments before an appropriate regimen is identified. From large-scale clinical trials (including STAR*D and COMED), at a population level, about 30% of patients achieve symptomatic remission for a given treatment and episode.1, 21 However, personalised medicine shifts focus away from population remission rates and general drug efficacy, and tries to identify which 30% of patients are the best candidates for a specific drug. As an example, although remission rates for all drug treatments were similar (48–52%), our ability to prospectively predict treatment outcome was not (51–65%). Of course, development of generally effective and rapidly effective antidepressant treatments would be important advances for public health. Until then, development and implementation of innovative statistical methods to choose the best available drug for each patient offers an interim solution.5, 41, 42 These findings are a step in the direction of precision medicine for psychiatry, but performance remains modest compared with that in other areas of medicine.

The success of these models depends on their ability to generalise. We took two important precautions. First, all variable selection and model building occurred during a repeated ten-fold cross-validation procedure. Second, we examined how the model trained on a large citalopram cohort would perform in other clinical trial cohorts with other treatment protocols, with differing recruitment criteria and distributions of symptoms. The external validation analysis showed that a citalopram model trained in the STAR*D cohort accurately predicted outcomes for the escitalopram treatment group of COMED. The model also showed significant accuracy in the escitalopram-buproprion group, but not in a combination SNRI group (venlafaxine-mirtazapine). This result shows that the model can successfully generalise to a completely independent sample, and has some degree of treatment specificity. The fact that the model failed to accurately predict response to the venlafaxine-mirtazapine group suggests that the model was not simply predicting a generic treatment response profile, nor was it predicting regression to the mean (or performance would have been equivalent for all three COMED groups). Our use of wholly independent validation cohorts also showed that, although fewer predictors might still confer comparable model performance in the STAR*D cohort, these smaller models did not generalise to the escitalopram group of an independent clinical trial (appendix), highlighting the importance of external validation.17

At a minimum, statistical (and biomarker) models must show above chance performance to be useful. In our STAR*D analyses, an accuracy of 53·13% would have statistically outperformed the chance accuracy of 51·3% with this sample size, by conventional standards (p<0·05). Our model achieved an accuracy of 64·6%, surpassing this benchmark substantially. By contrast, clinical prediction of who will respond to which treatment is typically poor.38 Similarly, in a pilot sample of psychiatrists and residents, the mean accuracy of 23 clinicians in predicting treatment outcome for 26 STAR*D patients was 49·3%, (where chance was 53·9%; appendix).

Our study has some limitations. Our assessment of clinician's ability to predict outcomes was preliminary, and future work will be needed to better quantify the accuracy of clinical judgment. At present, our model is not sufficiently powerful to justify withholding medication from a predicted non-responder, especially since medication could feasibly be the optimum treatment option for a predicted non-responder. However, a positive prediction is not trivial: compared with the baseline rate of antidepressant response, it more than doubles our confidence that a given patient is going to respond to citalopram (which could potentially confer additional placebo benefits).43 Performance could be improved by including a greater selection of clinical or behavioural variables—we did not have some demographic variables (eg, income) that have previously been associated with treatment outcome in univariate analyses16—and perhaps further still with genetic or brain-based measures together with patient-reported data when training machine-learning algorithms. Crucially, this study offers a statistical pipeline to identify useful predictors from a large number of variables and combine them for clinical prediction.

Firm conclusions cannot be made about the model's ability to predict differential responses to various drugs studied. No pure placebo condition was used in these trials, and sample sizes in each COMED treatment group are small relative to STAR*D. Future work should assess the extent to which the differential predictive power of this approach for distinct medications reflects the distinctive neural mechanisms probed in these clinical trials, heterogeneity in the underlying neurobiology of depression among the patients who entered the trials, or indeed a more general detection of non-response.

More broadly, the ultimate goal is to identify choice-markers: that is, markers that simultaneously predict response to drug A, and non-response to drug B. Until then, we are guiding choice by sequentially identifying responders and non-responders for a specific drug (or drug combination). With a large enough dataset, including several treatment options (including non-pharmacological interventions),43, 44 such a methodological approach should be useful to develop an algorithm that matches patients to the best treatment option among alternatives. In the immediate term, a machine-learned model offers clinicians a quick and accessible tool to predict whether a specific patient will respond to citalopram. The success of this general approach depends crucially on collection and sharing of large-scale, clinical-grade datasets."
"Depression prediction by using ecological momentary assessment, actiwatch data, and machine learning: Observational study on older adults living alone","Background: Although geriatric depression is prevalent, diagnosis using self-reporting instruments has limitations when measuring the depressed mood of older adults in a community setting. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) by using wearable devices could be used to collect data to classify older adults into depression groups. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the classification of depression groups among older adults living alone. We focused on utilizing diverse data collected through a survey, an Actiwatch, and an EMA report related to depression. Methods: The prediction model using machine learning was developed in 4 steps: (1) data collection, (2) data processing and representation, (3) data modeling (feature engineering and selection), and (4) training and validation to test the prediction model. Older adults (N=47), living alone in community settings, completed an EMA to report depressed moods 4 times a day for 2 weeks between May 2017 and January 2018. Participants wore an Actiwatch that measured their activity and ambient light exposure every 30 seconds for 2 weeks. At baseline and the end of the 2-week observation, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Korean versions of the Short Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (K-HDRS). Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression was built and compared with 4 machine learning models (the logit, decision tree, boosted trees, and random forest models). Results: On the basis of the SGDS-K and K-HDRS, 38% (18/47) of the participants were classified into the probable depression group. They reported significantly lower scores of normal mood and physical activity and higher levels of white and red, green, and blue (RGB) light exposures at different degrees of various 4-hour time frames (all P<.05). Sleep efficiency was chosen for modeling through feature selection. Comparing diverse combinations of the selected variables, daily mean EMA score, daily mean activity level, white and RGB light at 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm exposure, and daily sleep efficiency were selected for modeling. Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression had a good model fit (accuracy: 0.705; precision: 0.770; specificity: 0.859; and area under receiver operating characteristic curve or AUC: 0.754). Among the 4 machine learning models, the logit model had the best fit compared with the others (accuracy: 0.910; precision: 0.929; specificity: 0.940; and AUC: 0.960). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for developing a machine learning program to predict the classification of depression groups in older adults living alone. Clinicians should consider using this method to identify underdiagnosed subgroups and monitor daily progression regarding treatment or therapeutic intervention in the community setting. Furthermore, more efforts are needed for researchers and clinicians to diversify data collection methods by using a survey, EMA, and a sensor. Heejung Kim, SungHee Lee, SangEun Lee, Soyun Hong, HeeJae Kang, Namhee Kim.","Principal Findings

The primary purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with geriatric depression in older adults living alone. We focused on developing a prediction model to classify the depression groups (probable depression vs nondepression) among older adults living alone. Along with the conventional instruments for depression screening, EMA of daily mood, actigraphy data of activity, and light exposure were utilized. Comparing diverse combinations of the selected variables, daily mean EMA score, daily mean activity, daily sleep efficiency, and exposure to white and RGB light between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm for 2 weeks were selected for modeling. The cross-validation process was used to build a prediction model. Logit model showed compatible evaluation metrics compared with the traditional binary logistic regression. The use of both EMA and sensor data seems promising to develop a machine learning model for better identification of a probable depression among older adults [25].
Comparison With Previous Studies

The depression group reported higher levels of daily depressed mood than did the nondepression group. In a small-scale study [17], the major depressive disorder (MDD) group reported higher levels of diurnal symptom patterns of negative affect with great variability than did the control group. Our study found that even the daily average of depressed mood was significantly related to the classification of depression groups determined by conventional screening [2,43]. This could help overcome a clinical challenge in diagnosing a psychiatric disorder during the first medical examination or interview by unfamiliar clinicians [2]. It can also be difficult for a person with a serious mental illness to complete the self-reporting questionnaire and for clinicians to make a quick diagnosis with limited time [6,44]. The findings of this study suggest that individuals with these difficulties may complete self-reports of depressed mood daily in their home environment. A simple question, although repetitive, might be more helpful to classify the probable depression groups as opposed to the application of complex and multiple-item questionnaires.

A significantly low level of daytime activity was observed in the depression group, similar to the findings of previous research [45]. A study [15] using actigraphy reported that patients with depression displayed less daytime motor activity than did individuals without depression. Related to the EMA of depression, high levels of momentary depressed mood had a lagged effect of prolonging the current status of being at home. Those who experience an increase in the average depressed mood the previous day tend to stay at home the following day [46]. Previous studies have reported that depressed people have decreased levels of daytime activity compared with healthy controls [2,15]. In adults aged over 60 years, depression is associated with lower levels of physical activity in global measure, compared with nondepressed individuals [47], similar to our study findings. In a meta-analysis of adults with MDD [48], more time was spent in sedentary behavior and less time in vigorous physical activities. Considering the relationship between physical activity and depression, promoting daytime physical activity could prevent the risk of depression in older adults [49].

Furthermore, sleep efficiency may be a potential factor to aid in classifying depression groups. Existing studies have confirmed the association between disrupted sleep and depression in adults [50-52] because sleep disturbance is one of the common misinterpreted symptoms of geriatric depression [6]. A study of older adults living alone found that depressed participants reported sleep-related issues [53]. However, our study did not clearly indicate that sleep efficiency was associated with the depression group because the sample size had low power to detect the significance (P<.08). Comparing with the findings of previous studies [12,54], this discrepancy should be interpreted with caution because the previous studies measured sleep components once through self-report, whereas our study assessed daily sleep efficiency for 2 weeks through repeated measures using actigraphy. Older adults living alone may have more difficulty in the early detection of sleep disturbances than do those living with others because of the absence of a bedroom partner [55]. Thus, further research using both subjective and objective measures is needed to confirm the predictive value of sleep efficiency with the larger sample.

Contrary to our expectation, higher levels of ambient light exposure were observed in the depression group, compared with the nondepression group. We expected that lower levels of ambient light exposure would be observed in the depression group compared with the nondepression group that had a less sedentary lifestyle and engaged in more outdoor activities [48]. There are limited explanations for this finding contrary to our hypothesis. A small-scale observational study [56] explored the subjective perception of lighting in depressed patients’ environment. When they were asked whether the lights in the surroundings seemed dimmer than usual, depressed patients answered that they perceived the environment to be dimmer than usual. Moreover, there was a significant association between depression severity and perception of dimness. Patients with severe (65%), moderate (21%), and mild (14%) depression responded that their ambient environment appeared dimmer than usual. To compensate for the perceived dim environment, they may turn on the lights at home most of the time or stay in places with more light. In addition, a depressed individual may turn on the lights to read books or do other things to compensate their awakening time at night. This behavior may affect heart rate variability, which is associated with mood regulation through ambient biofeedback [57]. Many relaxation methods or interventions use dimmed ambient lighting to soothe the patient [58], but individuals with depression may not prefer a dimmer environment that may increase the depressed mood.
Implications for Geriatric Depression Research

Our study findings support 3 major inferences: (1) diversifying data collection methods to build an accurate model of depression prediction, (2) emphasizing the need to assess depressed mood at different time points in a day, and (3) monitoring multiple symptoms continuously. First, inactivity and poor sleep have been known to be symptoms of geriatric depression; however, the assessment of these symptoms is limited to using subjective reports of inactivity, sedentary lifestyle, or night-time sleep. Our study emphasizes the need for collecting both subjective and objective data related to mood disorders and examining intraday change patterns. For example, it is difficult to apply the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score to depressed older adults. Thus, clinicians should evaluate sleep efficiency through actigraphy as an objective measure, which may prevent the misinterpretation of a suspected depression [6]. Second, time-specific assessment is required to capture the significant features of specific data. Our study findings confirmed group differences in daytime activity, light exposure in the late afternoon, and night-time sleep. Thus, we suggest the need to collect data throughout the day and identify features closely related to depression [12,45]. Third, we suggest using sensor data, such as Actiwatch or activity tracking, for monitoring purpose. For example, strategies to improve physical activity should be included in the treatment for geriatric depression [48]. Monitoring daily activity of people with mood disorders using Actiwatch may help diagnose depression depending on the activity-based interventions [15]. In addition, our study shows some potential to use environmental data, such as ambient light, in identifying depression in the community setting. Sensor devices have a great potential to continuously capture diverse mental health–related information from the environment or context [24,25] in mental health.
Implications of Electronic Health for Older Adults

EMA could be used as a diagnostic tool for depression in older adults. It has been used to assess multiple mental health indicators related to depressed mood [9]. In particular, older adults have less accurate retrospective memory, and therefore, the use of EMA for older adults can increase the accuracy of the assessment [10,59]. EMA has also been shown to have acceptability and feasibility for older adults, even those with cognitive and emotional difficulties [60]. In particular, EMA has the advantage of continuously reporting subjective symptoms according to the individual’s life patterns as digital phenotyping [44,61]. Thus, it is possible to collect personalized data, monitor the individual pattern, and examine fluctuations in the depressed mood within and between a day while reducing retrospective bias [10,11].

However, a limitation of this method is that multiple and repeated reports in a day are associated with a high dropout rate [11]. When applying EMA to older adults, sufficient device training and the practice of technical details could maximize the usability and appropriateness of EMA for older adults [60]. In our study, a dropout rate of 9% (5/53) was observed; thus, preventing dropout is important to ensure that older adults with depression complete multiple reports during the day after careful training and educating about the significance of EMA [11,16,62]. Selection of valid questions to measure momentary depressed mood and standardizing the EMA protocols are also important. Therefore, geropsychiatric clinicians should prepare to select the proper device, train older adults, and prevent dropout [16].

The paper-based diary approach has been traditionally used for older adults [6,63]; however, sometimes they do not accurately report their depressed mood because of response or retrospective bias or the social stigma associated with mental health illnesses [6,10,44,59]. Actigraphy is a noninvasive technique that provides simple and scientifically accurate data on a daily basis and can be used to improve health-related behaviors [64], thus suggesting its suitability for older adults. The 9% (5/53) dropout rate in our study indicates the acceptability and applicability of the Actiwatch for older adults, similar to a previous finding [11], especially as we identified a variety of subjective and objective factors that reflected an individual’s real-world environment, such as depressed mood, activity, sleep, and different light using a ubiquitous device.

Actigraphy also measures fluctuating subjective mood on a daily basis in real time and a natural environment through continuous recording [9] along with physical and environmental data [11]. An integrated approach to passive, objective, and continuous measurement has been used in psychiatry practice and research [44]. Moreover, passive actigraphy data and active EMA responses can be useful for understanding the characteristics of depression, offering insight into biological and environmental mechanisms underlying the depression, and developing individualized interventions for older adults [65]. Considering the rapid development of technologies, various types of sensor data may be used in geropsychiatric care for screening, monitoring, and diagnosing mental health [66-68]. Therefore, we expect that new measures, such as using sensor data, will help diagnose depression quickly and improve mental health problems.
Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, we used 2 screening instruments that relied on subjective reports to classify individuals in the 2 depression groups because these instruments had been widely used in community settings. However, a medical diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–5 may be needed to define the clinically diagnosed depression group for data processing and representation [6]. In addition, further study may replicate our model including nondepressed older adults to establish screening models in general population. Although the EMA provides mood reports of older adults at the 4 time points every day for 2 weeks, our predictive model used daily grand mean that was relatively less frequent for EMA data collection. Replication studies that utilize data variability within a day should be tested over a longer time frame and use a more convenient mode to complete EMA to reduce subjective burden. Generalization of the EMA data and levels of activity is limited because every individual has different levels of normal with reference to a depressed mood or inactivity [6,11]. Thus, EMA with a real-life tagging system will be helpful to examine to what extent the data fluctuate from the average level for each individual. In addition, studies with larger samples are needed to ensure the generalizability of our findings considering the possible use of machine learning, which is an innovative method of feature extraction from data [21]. Specifically, the limited generalizability is expected for depressed men in older populations because the majority of older adults were women in Korea. Thus, it is necessary to oversample the groups of men for the next study on this topic [4]."
Depressive Symptoms Feature-Based Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Depression Using Smartphone,"With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients suffering from depression is rising around the world. It is important to diagnose depression early so that it may be treated as soon as possible. The self-response questionnaire, which has been used to diagnose depression in hospitals, is impractical since it requires active patient engagement. Therefore, it is vital to have a system that predicts depression automatically and recommends treatment. In this paper, we propose a smartphone-based depression prediction system. In addition, we propose depressive features based on multimodal sensor data for predicting depressive mood. The multimodal depressive features were designed based on depression symptoms defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The proposed system comprises a “Mental Health Protector” application that collects data from smartphones and a big data-based cloud platform that processes large amounts of data. We recruited 106 mental patients and collected smartphone sensor data and self-reported ques-tionnaires from their smartphones using the proposed system. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed system’s prediction of depression. As the test dataset, 27 out of 106 participants were selected randomly. The proposed system showed 76.92% on an f1-score for 16 patients with depression disease, and in particular, 15 patients, 93.75%, were successfully predicted. Unlike previ-ous studies, the proposed method has high adaptability in that it uses only smartphones and has a distinction of evaluating prediction accuracy based on the diagnosis.  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Our goal was to examine the feasibility of predicting depression using smartphones in patients with mental illness. In order to verify the prediction system, the accuracy of depressed mood prediction was investigated using the collected data of 106 participants with mental health disorders. The results verify our system’s applicability to patients with mental disorders. In addition, an analysis of depression severity assessments (PHQ-9 and CESD-R) is provided.
4.1. Analysis
When the accuracy of predicting depression by PHQ-9 (cut-point ≥ 10) was calculated as the designed induction characteristic, 74.07% performance was shown. The accuracy of depression prediction by CESD-R (cut-point ≥ 13) was 77.08%. The PHQ-9 and CESD-R experiments differ in terms of data balance in addition to performance. We hypothesized that the high accuracy of CESD-R is due to a data imbalance because the number of depression/non-depression groups divided based on the cut-point is PHQ-9 (55:51) and CESD-R (84:22), respectively. Therefore, we investigated why questionnaire-based performance differences occurred and which questionnaire is suitable for the proposed system.
We consider that identifying people diagnosed with depression is more important than accurately predicting depression based on questionnaire responses. When smartphone data are collected from the general public, analysis is impossible due to the absence of medical diagnostic information for the participants. However, we recruited participants to collect smartphone data from mental patients. Therefore, the participants we recruited have been diagnosed by clinicians. We focused on examining the relationship between the proposed system and patients diagnosed with depression because the proposed system aims to automatically pre-detect users with signs of depression and recommend treatment. Therefore, it is important for our system to accurately identify depressed patients.
To investigate the relationship between the proposed system’s predictions and diagnosis, we divided the disorders of the participants into depression and non-depression diseases. In the experiment, PHQ-9 and CESD-R were each set as the ground truth, and the predictions and diagnosis were compared. When compared to the diagnosis, the results of CESD-R were convincing. CESD-R predicted that 15 (93.75%) out of 16 participants with depression are depressed. In contrast, PHQ-9 predicted that 11 (68.75%) out of 16 participants are depressed. CESD-R showed optimal performance in detecting patients with depression. In addition, experiments including non-depressed patients for CESD-R provide higher performance, with f1-scores of 61.88%, than PHQ-9. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is efficient to utilize CESD-R in the proposed system to effectively predict a larger number of depressed patients.
4.2. Lessons
We collected smartphone data on patients with mental disorders. Using the collected datasets, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed depression prediction system. However, there are still some limitations to the practical use of the proposed system. The participants included in the collected data were recruited from a single hospital. In addition, it cannot be assured that the sample size is sufficient. This makes it difficult to generalize our results. Therefore, the general growth of the proposed system requires public data collection. In addition, future studies should collect larger samples.
As it only supports Android-based devices, it is impossible to ensure that it would perform well for iOS-based devices. The “Mental Health Protector” application operates only on Android-based smartphones. While collecting smartphone data, the application should run in the background. According to iOS’s security policy, it is not possible to collect sensor data in the background. Because our system does not support iOS, we were unable to collect data from a significant number of participants. Therefore, it is necessary for future research to develop an iOS-based application so they may collect all data.
In this paper, various multimodal-based passive sensor datasets are collected using the “Mental Health Protector”. However, only GPS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Facial Expression Features, and Screen on/off are utilized in the proposed system. We have attempted to use various data in the design of derived features. However, due to unanticipated difficulties with the collected data, it was not possible to extract significant derived features. For example, since the viewpoint of the acquired facial image was not fixed, it was difficult to compare the landmarks precisely. Therefore, it is essential to develop an application with specificity to prevent noise in feature extraction.
5. Conclusions
We propose an automated depression prediction system using smartphones. By newly proposing image-based derived features, we propose a multimodal-based derived features design method related to depression. To collect data and predict depression, we construct a system consisting of a smartphone application and a big data-based cloud platform. Based on the established system, multimodal data of 106 participants who visited psychiatry and two self-reported questionnaires were collected. This paper shows the feasibility of depression prediction using data from 106 people collected through the proposed system. In addition, it was shown to be effective for depressed patients by comparing the doctor’s diagnosis with the proposed system’s predictions. In future studies, the accuracy of automated depression prediction may be enhanced by including hospital-visiting patient data into the model as a recommendation by the proposed system."
Developing a nomogram for predicting depression in diabetic patients after COVID-19 using machine learning,"Objective: This study identified major risk factors for depression in community diabetic patients using machine learning techniques and developed predictive models for predicting the high-risk group for depression in diabetic patients based on multiple risk factors. Methods: This study analyzed 26,829 adults living in the community who were diagnosed with diabetes by a doctor. The prevalence of a depressive disorder was the dependent variable in this study. This study developed a model for predicting diabetic depression using multiple logistic regression, which corrected all confounding factors in order to identify the relationship (influence) of predictive factors for diabetic depression by entering the top nine variables with high importance, which were identified in CatBoost. Results: The prevalence of depression was 22.4% (n = 6,001). This study calculated the importance of factors related to depression in diabetic patients living in South Korean community using CatBoost to find that the top nine variables with high importance were gender, smoking status, changes in drinking before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in smoking before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, subjective health, concern about economic loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in sleeping hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic activity, and the number of people you can ask for help in a disaster situation such as COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: It is necessary to identify the high-risk group for diabetes and depression at an early stage, while considering multiple risk factors, and to seek a personalized psychological support system at the primary medical level, which can improve their mental health. Copyright  2023 Byeon.","This study identified the prevalence of depression among diabetic patients living in South Korean local communities using national survey data conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic and found that 22.4% of the subjects were diabetic patients with depression. The prevalence of depression among diabetic patients living in South Korean local communities was approximately twice the prevalence of depression among healthy people (12%) during the period (18). Although it cannot be directly compared with the results of this study, the meta-analysis of Anderson et al. (19), conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, reported that depression in diabetic patients (28.5%) was 1.5 times higher than that in the general population (16.2%). Even though diabetic patients in local communities are at high risk of depression, not enough active attention has been given to their emotional aspects. It has been reported that when depression accompanies diabetes, medical costs increase because glycemic control deteriorates, the incidence of chronic complications increases, and mortality rises (20–22). Furthermore, if a diabetic patient cannot properly perform health behaviors due to depression, it can adversely affect the long-term course of diabetes, such as the occurrence of chronic complications, as well as glycemic control (23). Consequently, in order to efficiently screen depression in diabetic patients at an early stage, studies need to identify the risk factors for depression.

The results of this study confirmed that gender, subjective health, increased health risk behaviors such as drinking and smoking, decreased sleeping hours, and the number of people whom you could seek help in a disaster situation such as COVID-19 infection were independent risk factors of depression. These results agreed with the results of previous studies (24–27). Female sex, marital status, childhood adversity, and social deprivation are general population risk factors for depression that also apply to people with diabetes (28).

Gender is known to be a major factor influencing diabetic patients. Adriaanse et al. (24) analyzed depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients and reported that the prevalence of depression was significantly higher in women (15%) than in men (9.1%), which concurred with the results of this study. Moreover, a decrease in sleeping hours has been reported as a significant predictor of diabetic depression. Ghosh et al. (25) showed that a quarter of diabetic patients with depression experienced a decrease in sleeping hours. Particularly, the number of people subjects could ask for help in a disaster situation was a key factor related to diabetic depression. Social support is known to be another major risk factor for diabetic depression. Pibernik-Okanovic (26) found that diabetic patients who felt a lack of social support had a higher risk of developing depression, which supported the results of this study. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a psychological support program for diabetic patients in the community to increase their ability to cope with depression caused by social distancing in the era of COVID-19 and limited social contact and build a system that can continuously provide medical and social support for diabetic patients without sufficient social support to prevent depression in diabetic patients.

In this study, the number of diabetic complication tests in the past year, awareness of blood glucose levels, and diabetic treatment methods (e.g., oral hypoglycemic drug and insulin injection treatment) were not related to depression in diabetic patients, which did not agree with the results of previous studies (1, 29, 30). Numerous studies (1, 29) have proven the relationship between glycemic control and depression in diabetic patients. When glycemic control was poorer, depression symptoms were more severe (29). It is backed by the results that a higher level of glycated hemoglobin decreases the effects of antidepressants (1). It is speculated that the awareness of blood glucose levels or the number of diabetes complication tests based on a survey alone was not enough to directly identify the blood glucose management level of diabetic patients. Therefore, although previous studies (1, 29) reported that managing blood glucose is related to the depression of diabetic patients, the relationship was not significant in this study.

The mechanism underlying the high risk of depression in diabetic patients has not been clearly understood. There are some possible explanations: depression may induce insulin resistance by stimulating the secretion of insulin-antagonizing hormones (e.g., catecholamines, glucocorticoids, growth hormones, and glucagon) and inflammatory cytokines, or it can contribute to the development of diabetes by causing dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells. Moreover, diabetes may cause depression in association with inadequate glycemic control, the development of chronic complications due to diabetes, and a decline in socioeconomic status. However, since depression is caused by multiple factors rather than a single factor, future studies need to identify the relationship between blood glucose management and depression using clinical test data such as HbA1c level in addition to sociodemographic and psychological characteristics.

Another finding of this study was that the results of this study showed that “female diabetic patients who had fewer sleeping hours after the COVID-19 pandemic, increased the frequency of smoking and drinking increased than before the pandemic, concerned about economic loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had no one to ask for help, and perceived subjective health as poor had an 88% predictive possibility of depression,” which was high. Since multiple risk factors for diabetic depression have not been clearly identified, it is needed to carry out future studies on multiple risk factors for diabetic depression based on large-scale cohort data. It is also necessary to continuously monitor depression in terms of primary care for diabetic patients with these multiple risk factors.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly conducts regular monitoring of comorbidities in diabetic patients and runs a chronic disease prevention program (31). On the other hand, South Korea lacks a systematic monitoring system for diabetic depression management, and previous studies mainly examined multi-center registry data for diabetic depression (32, 33). Particularly, in South Korea, mental health management and education such as depression for diabetic patients are mainly carried out in general hospitals (32). Considering the fact that general hospitals are playing a critical role in the emergency medical response system in a disaster situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic (34), it will be required to establish a systematic depression examination and monitoring system centered on primary care in the future for the sustainability mental health management of diabetic patients.

The strength of this study was that it identified a high-risk group for depression in diabetic patients using national survey data conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic and provided baseline data for preventing depression in diabetic patients. This study had several limitations. First, since this study analyzed secondary data by analyzing epidemiological data (survey data), clinical indicators such as insulin-antagonizing hormones and genes related to depression were not included. Second, the in-person survey may underestimate health risk behaviors such as smoking and drinking. Therefore, future studies need to reduce the possibility of recall bias including medical records in order to identify factors related to diabetic depression. Third, the Community Health Survey, the source data, did not survey the duration of diabetes. Future studies need to investigate the duration of diabetes and duration of diabetic complications additionally to develop a diabetes depression predictive model with higher predictive performance. Fourth, since this study was a cross-sectional study, even if risk factors for diabetic depression were identified in this study, it could not be interpreted as a causal relationship based on temporal precedence.

5. Conclusion
It is necessary to identify the high-risk groups for diabetes and depression at an early stage while considering multiple risk factors and provide a tailored psychological support system at the primary medical level to improve their mental health. Additionally, it is important to establish a system that can systematically monitor the high-risk groups for diabetes and depression, even in long-term disaster situations (e.g., pandemic), at the community level. Furthermore, additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the causal relationship between factors related to diabetic depression identified in this study."
Development and performance analysis of machine learning methods for predicting depression among menopausal women,"Menopause is an obligatory phenomenon in a woman's life. Some women face mental and physical issues during their menopausal period. Depression is one of the issues some women struggle with during their menopausal period. The scarcity of specialists, lack of knowledge, and awareness is the motivating factor in this research to predict depression among menopausal women and enhance their quality of life. The prediction of depression symptoms among menopausal women with machine learning techniques is promising and challenging in artificial intelligence. This study develops a system with significant accuracy using a supervised machine-learning approach. Various classification algorithms are used to determine the best-performing classifier by evaluating multiple parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F-Measure, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Precision–Recall_ Curve (PRC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). We found that Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are the performers with 99.04% accuracy employing the 14 most significant features.  2023 The Author(s)","In this study, four different supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, such as Decision tree, AdaBoost Classifier, XGBoost, and Random Forest Classifier. Different parameters of these algorithms were analyzed and compared to get the best performer classification algorithm among them. The result and performance of all the applied classifiers have been discussed in this section. Table 3 states the statistical representation of all the features of the dataset including numeric and binary. Table 3 explains that 78% of menopausal women are facing depression. Of the women who do not face hot flashes, menstruation, and breathing issues 82.61%, 88.37% and 84.48% respectively are not facing depression. Besides, 94.34% of women without having menopausal knowledge experience depression during the menopausal period. On the other hand, 94.38% of women who do not face depression during the menopausal period have pill knowledge. Most menopausal women face depression duration menopause with osteoporosis, heartbeat, tension, concentration, pressure or tightness in the head, tingling, and headache issues. In addition to that, it is found that the average age and age difference is 31.19 and 10.59 years for women facing depression. Finally, it can be decided that having pill knowledge is crucial for women who are passing through the menopausal period.Fig. 3(A) represents a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot for the experiment of the density of participants according to age distribution. It is found that age groups from 15 to 30 years, and 50 to 70 years are denser than other age groups for the participants who are experiencing depression. However, the age group from 50 to 70 years is denser for the participant who is not facing depression. Fig. 3(B) represents the KDE plot for the experiment of the density of participants according to the distribution of age difference of the participant from their husbands. It is found that the age difference of 9 to 11 years is denser for both groups of participants.

c. Performance Analysis

In Section 3.2.5 under Section 3, it is shown that a confusion matrix is derived from every classifier. From the result of the confusion matrix, the performance for all classifiers is estimated based on different parameters. The rest of the section will analyze the performance of all applied classifiers for tracing the best-performer classifiers for the proposed system.

Table 4 demonstrates the outcome of different kinds of performance metrics with values of the classification algorithms such as Decision tree, AdaBoost Classifier, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier., which is found exploiting these algorithms on the menopausal dataset. These performance parameters are used to evaluate the suitable classification algorithm compared with other classifiers. Table 3 represents that RF is the best-performing classifier with 97.11% accuracy and 0.97 precision, recall, and F1 score along with 0.996 log loss.

Fig. 4 visualizes the feature importance values of each applied classification algorithm. It also represents the most significant risk factors with high values. According to the figure, age, tiredness, and menopause are the most significant risk factors. Besides, ost, knowledge, headaches heart beats, tingling, and excitability are also important symptoms for having depression among menopausal women.

Table 5 demonstrates the most significant risk factors, which is 14 in number. These risk factors are identified by the feature importance score of each applied classification algorithm. The most frequent risk factors are collected for further machine learning analysis. According to the table, age, ost, knowledge heartbeat, and others are represented in the last column of Table 5.Table 6 represents the outcome of different kinds of performance metrics with values of the applied classification algorithms such as Decision tree, AdaBoost Classifier, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier., which is found exploiting these algorithms on the 14 most significant features of the menopausal dataset. It is observed that Random Forest and XGBoost are the best-performing classifier with 99.04% accuracy and 0.99 precision, recall, and F1 score along with 0.332 log loss.Fig. 5 depicts the performance comparison between the performance of the entire dataset and the 14 most significant features. The figure illustrates the performance of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss. According to the figure, the 14 most significant features have produced a better performance by every performance metric for the detection of depression among menopausal women. So, these 14 most significant features are able to detect depression among menopausal women.

AUROC is one of the major characteristics, which measures the performance of a classification algorithm. It is mostly used characteristics to evaluate the performance of any classifiers. Fig. 6(A) and (B) illustrate the AUROC of different applied classifiers for all the features and 14 most significant features respectively to visualize the performance of applied classifiers graphically. Fig. 6(A) demonstrates that the Random Forest classifier is showing a superior result to any other result. Random Forest classifier covers 99.7% area under the ROC curve, which is the best result for all the features. On the other hand, the Random Forest classifier is the best-performing classifier with 100% performance for the 14 most significant features, which is illustrated in Fig. 6(B).

The Precision–Recall curve is another major characteristic of a machine learning model, which represents the performance of the model. The following figure describes the precision–recall curve of all the applied classifiers. Fig. 6(B) and (D) represent the precision–recall curve for all the features and 14 most features respectively. The curve analysis demonstrates that the performance of the AdaBoost classifier is not satisfactory since they are showing the least performance compared to the other classifiers for both 6(B) and (D). Though the Random Forest classifier is providing the best outcome for both cases, 14 most features produced better performance than the performance produced by all the features. So, Random Forest is the most suitable classification algorithm in this case with the 14 most significant features.

In summary, we gathered a menopausal dataset with respect to depression. The collected dataset was preprocessed as necessary. For a better understanding of the dataset, EDA and statistical data analyses were employed on the dataset. To develop the machine learning model, we selected four machine learning algorithms: Adaboost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These algorithms were applied to the processed dataset and compared all the algorithm’s performances based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, MCC, ROC, and PRC. In addition, the ROC and Precision–Recall_ curves were produced to test the models. Then we found the most significant risk factors with respect to each applied algorithm, which is 14 in number. Then we again applied machine learning algorithms to the most significant features and found significant performances of all the applied algorithms. Where Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers generated the best performance with 99.04% accuracy. So, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers can be applied to predict depression among menopausal women employing the 14 most significant features mentioned in Table 5. This study will help psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinicians to predict depression among menopausal women. Sometimes, due to less severity of symptoms, it is not possible to predict depression among menopausal women by psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinicians. Since depression causes serious mental and physical ailments, it is very crucial to predict whether a menopausal woman is depressed or not. From this point of view, this study will play a crucial role to predict depression and ensuring quality of life among menopausal women. The proposed model can be deployed on mobile application, web applications and other software.

5. Conclusion
The depression of menopausal women unquestionably disrupts the quality of life. Depression is also a fundamental issue that induces severe physical and mental ailments. Most of the women do not take this into consideration because of a lack of awareness and knowledge. In addition, limitations of psychiatric diagnosis and high costs, which are other reasons to skip the issue. In order to solve this kind of problem, machine learning plays a key role in predicting and detecting numerous issues in the age of scientific development. From that perspective, a prediction system is developed in this study to predict depression among menopausal women. Numerous machine learning classification algorithms are employed on a raw dataset. From all of these algorithms, a superior performer algorithm is chosen for the proposed method based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-Measure. It is observed that Random Forest and XGBoost show significantly better outcomes than other classifiers with the 14 most significant features. This study aims to provide a simple and user-friendly prediction system, which is easy to use."
Development and validation of a machine learning algorithm for predicting the risk of postpartum depression among pregnant women,"Objective: There is a scarcity in tools to predict postpartum depression (PPD). We propose a machine learning framework for PPD risk prediction using data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). Methods: Two EHR datasets containing data on 15,197 women from 2015 to 2018 at a single site, and 53,972 women from 2004 to 2017 at multiple sites were used as development and validation sets, respectively, to construct the PPD risk prediction model. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of PPD within 1 year following childbirth. A framework of data extraction, processing, and machine learning was implemented to select a minimal list of features from the EHR datasets to ensure model performance and to enable future point-of-care risk prediction. Results: The best-performing model uses from clinical features related to mental health history, medical comorbidity, obstetric complications, medication prescription orders, and patient demographic characteristics. The model performances as measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) are 0.937 (95% CI 0.912 - 0.962) and 0.886 (95% CI 0.879-0.893) in the development and validation datasets, respectively. The model performances were consistent when tested using data ending at multiple time periods during pregnancy and at childbirth. Limitations: The prevalence of PPD in the study data represented a treatment prevalence and is likely lower than the illness prevalence. Conclusions: EHRs and machine learning offer the ability to identify women at risk for PPD early in their pregnancy. This may facilitate scalable and timely prevention and intervention, reducing negative outcomes and the associated burden.  2020","Results from this study suggest a promising direction to leverage routinely collected EHR data to identify pregnant women at risk for PPD. Selected EHR-driven predictors characterize women's health history, pregnancy health, demographics, and healthcare utilization. Several known PPD risk factors from the literature were represented by variables extracted in the sequential feature selection process, including history of anxiety, mood disorder, and other mental disorders, antidepressant use, incidental mental health illnesses during pregnancy, cesarean section, and single motherhood.(Forman et al., 2000; Stewart and Vigod, 2016) Our model further identifies additional comorbid predictors, including palpitations, diarrhea, vomiting during pregnancy, hypertensive disorders and hypothyroidism. Among these comorbidities, thyroid dysfunction and hypertensive disorders have been associated with PPD onset in previous literature.(Le Donne et al., 2017; Strapasson et al., 2018) Palpitation, a common cardiac symptom, may also be a symptom of depression that was discovered by the model.(Alijaniha et al., 2016; Barsky et al., 1994) In addition, medication prescriptions of beta blocking agents and antihistamines were identified as predictors. Literature has reported the use of both beta blockers and antihistamines in association with depression although not conclusively (Yudofsky, 1992)(Gerstman et al., 1996; Ozdemir et al., 2014). Related to mode of delivery, our model selected cesarean section as a risk factor for PPD, as also studied in the previous literature.(Carter et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2017) Lastly, the number of ED visits during pregnancy and postpartum may be an indicator of a lack of proper access to primary and obstetric care.(Sheen et al., 2019)

As seen in our experiments, the risk computed by the PPD prediction algorithm updates in response to the new health information that accumulates overtime with repeated visits during pregnancy, thereby potentially allowing care providers to take timely actions according to the risk evolution. (Committee, 2018; Earls et al., 2019) With these automatically extractable features, an EHR-based prediction tool may assist with existing EHR interventions for screening to minimize variations across clinical practices in screening and information collection.(Long et al., 2019)Previous studies have reported that while the rates of screening and referrals for mental health care can be high when obstetricians recognize a risk for PPD, but they are low if symptoms are unnoticed by the care provider.(Goodman and Tyer-Viola, 2010) Our risk prediction model, by identifying women with elevated risk, may assist with tacitly raising clinician awareness of PPD and potentially increasing screening and referral rates."
Development and validation of a machine learning-based postpartum depression prediction model: A nationwide cohort study,"Background: Currently, postpartum depression (PPD) screening is mainly based on self-report symptom-based assessment, with lack of an objective, integrative tool which identifies women at increased risk, before the emergent of PPD. We developed and validated a machine learning-based PPD prediction model utilizing electronic health record (EHR) data, and identified novel PPD predictors. Methods: A nationwide longitudinal cohort that included 214,359 births between January 2008 and December 2015, divided into model training and validation sets, was constructed utilizing Israel largest health maintenance organization's EHR-database. PPD was defined as new diagnosis of a depressive episode or antidepressant prescription within the first year postpartum. A gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm was applied to EHR-derived sociodemographic, clinical, and obstetric features. Results: Among the birth cohort, 1.9% (n = 4104) met the case definition of new-onset PPD. In the validation set, the prediction model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.712 (95% confidence interval, 0.690–0.733), with a sensitivity of 0.349 and a specificity of 0.905 at the 90th percentile risk threshold, identifying PPDs at a rate more than three times higher than the overall set (positive and negative predictive values were 0.074 and 0.985, respectively). The model's strongest predictors included both well-recognized (e.g., past depression) and less-recognized (differing patterns of blood tests) PPD risk factors. Conclusions: Machine learning-based models incorporating EHR-derived predictors, could augment symptom-based screening practice by identifying the high-risk population at greatest need for preventive intervention, before development of PPD.  2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","In this study, utilizing a nationwide birth cohort, we have developed and validated a machine learning prediction model for assessing at birth the risk to develop PPD within a year following delivery. This PPD prediction model enables the stratification of postpartum women into distinct risk groups by using routinely collected EHR data. Furthermore, improved characterization of births at high risk for PPD was achieved by analyzing the distribution of the model's prediction features. Finally, model performance was evaluated for particular subsets of the births population, and a simpler, Q-based, model was created using the most impactful predictors that a woman can report in a direct interview. Implementation of our prediction tool into public health systems may facilitate early PPD detection and intervention programs to reduce depression rates, depression severity, and related negative outcomes.

In the era of personalized medicine, it appears that clinical risk prediction models based on advanced analytic algorithms have the potential to support health care professionals in their decision making for further testing, monitoring, preventive interventions, and informing patients about their risk of a particular disease (Fusar-Poli et al., 2018). The majority of published PPD prediction tools are limited in their implementation feasibility to routine practice due to dependency on prospective follow-up, the collection of auxiliary, not routinely tested, biological and clinical measures, and employing classic analytic tools (Austin et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008; L. Osborne et al., 2016). Unfortunately, only few studies have employed advanced machine learning models or routinely collected EHR data (Jiménez-Serrano et al., 2015; Tortajada et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019; W. Zhang et al., 2020; Y. Zhang et al., 2020). Recently, Wang et al. (2019) and Y. Zhang et al. (2020), conducted two sequential studies on the feasibility of using a machine learning approach on EHR data to predict PPD (their models' best prediction performances achieved an AUROC of 0.79 and 0.88 in the validation sets). While their work suggests a potential for further large-scale studies, it was restricted to a study cohort derived only from the EHR of an urban academic medical center, thus limiting the generalizability of their findings. Similarly, W. Zhang et al. (2020), applied machine learning algorithms on a relatively small sample size of a prospective cohort of pregnant women collecting auxiliary psychometric inventories as part of the model prediction features (achieving effective PPD prediction performance: AUROC of 0.78). In comparison to these previously published models, to our knowledge, our work is among the first to apply advanced machine learning tools using both gestational and pre-gestational EHR data in a nationally representative sample of the general population, in an attempt to create a screening tool. Moreover, our model is not dependent on complementary data not routinely collected, does not require prospective follow-up after birth, and aims to differentiate between new-onset PPD from chronic depression. In our model, the efficacy of the prediction was satisfactory achieving AUROC of 0.712, which is in the range of the above-mentioned studies (Wang et al., 2019; W. Zhang et al., 2020). Nevertheless, it is important to recognize the overlapping top predictors (in both previous published PPD prediction models and our model) to be included in any future PPD prediction models. These include maternal age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, history of mental illness, in some models premenstrual related mood instability, obesity, and the existence of subclinical depressive or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (for health systems where routine psychometric inventories assessed during gestation are available).

Currently, standard of care for detection of depression in the postpartum period, is mainly based on health system screening programs with the application of a single screening instrument performed by a health-care provider to assess active depressive symptoms in a short time frame of the first postpartum weeks (Glasser, 2010; O'Connor et al., 2016). The existing postpartum follow-up practice faces the challenges of identifying women at risk for PPD (Curry et al., 2019) before presentation of symptoms, and overcoming barriers of postpartum women's reluctance for proactive help-seeking (Dennis & Chung-Lee, 2006). Thus, current practice might fail in detecting post-screening emergent PPD symptoms (Yawn et al., 2015) with subsequent delay in diagnosis and treatment and higher rates of negative outcomes. Our PPD prediction model meets the need for a risk stratification tool that enables, before presentation of depressive symptoms, the identification of women at various PPD risk score thresholds that would benefit from preventive interventions (Curry et al., 2019). Our model is less dependent on the woman's subjective perception of health status and health care-seeking behavior, thus facilitating more automated early detection to accurately target populations for long-standing interventions.

Interrogating our model performance, we found a similar prediction accuracy across maternal age risk groups (Johansen et al., 2020) and for primiparous women, with decrease performance when the population of births was stratified according to history of psychiatric disorder, implying the significant contribution of this predictor to our model. Furthermore, while the main model, based on the entire EHR data, provided a better prediction accuracy, a simpler and easier to implement Q-based model preformed with only a modest reduction in accuracy. Thus, it seems that a direct interview of the woman in the treating physician's or nurse's office, assessing the predefined nine impactful items, can be a useful alternative for some health care systems where full EHR data is not available or not accessible, as proposed for other fields of clinical risk prediction models (Artzi et al., 2020).

In contrast to the authors' expectations, the model has relatively low PPV values (Table 2), which may be related to the low rate of PPD in the study cohort (Fusar-Poli et al., 2018). Still, an attempt to utilize an improved version of the current model is justified. At present, the model should be considered a complementary tool to the symptom-based screening of peripartum women. The long-term intent is to establish an improved two-steps screening program, hopefully with higher values of PPV and NPV. Future efforts should focus on improving the detection of PPD cases in the population by incorporating symptom-based screening results into the PPD prediction model, thus attempting to improve its performance. To that end, screening data (e.g., EPDS) have to be made available in digitized format.

An additional contribution of this study is the characterization of a population at high risk to develop PPD to serve as a model validation. The top features in our model are in agreement with previous studies, that found that the subpopulation at high risk for PPD has a higher rate of past depression, increased pregestational BMI, increased tobacco use, and lower weight and gestational age at birth (McCoy et al., 2006; Molyneaux et al., 2014; Norhayati et al., 2015; Szegda et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019), but moreover, include novel biological PPD predictors as differing patterns of hematological and inflammatory blood tests, supporting current hypotheses for the involvement of inflammation and altered hematologic measures in the pathogenesis of PPD (L. M. Osborne & Monk, 2013; Wassef et al., 2019; Yim et al., 2015). As opposed to previous findings (Shwartz et al., 2019; W. Zhang et al., 2020), belonging to an ethnic minority and low SES groups in our model was inversely associated with a high risk of PPD, suggesting a possible cultural barrier for seeking professional help and underdiagnosis among this subpopulations.
4.1 Strength and limitations

The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of the following limitations. The exclusion from the study's cohort women with noncontinuous CHS coverage as well as mothers of nonsingleton births and births ending with infant death or women with a history of depressive episodes occurring within six months before gestation or during pregnancy, may limit the generalizability of the results, as may the exclusion of women with coprescriptions of lithium or antipsychotics, which are likely to represent the most severely depressed ones. To overcome these limitations, a replicative study should include all birthing mothers regardless of their newborns' survival during their first year or of their history of depressive episodes or use of antipsychotics or lithium. It is likely that the exclusion of women with noncontinuous CHS coverage may add to the bias in our model (n_=_9326 [4%]; Figure 1). A future study would have to include all comers as well as the use of survival methodology to account for censoring.

Previous studies suggested that women experiencing subclinical levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy are at increased risk to develop full major depressive episodes during the postpartum period (Andersson et al., 2006; Khanlari et al., 2019). Our model does capture this at-risk population. Moreover, it captures women who exhibited increased utilization of health-care services during the pregnancy period, which may be an indicator of the emergence of PPD.

According to the contemporary diagnostic nosology, PPD is characterized as a specifier of the outbreak of a depressive episode within 4 weeks after delivery. This study considered PPD as being present within the year following delivery, where there was either a new documented diagnosis of depressive episode or a new prescription for antidepressants. This is consistent with a previous research that has shown that the period of elevated risk for the development of PPD is up to one year following delivery (O'Hara & McCabe, 2013; Silverman et al., 2017) and in agreement with the USPSTF recommendations for interventions to prevent perinatal depression (Curry et al., 2019). Furthermore, the 1-year time point was chosen to maximize sensitivity for detection of women who do not present until later in the postpartum course, as is often the case in PPD (Dennis & Chung-Lee, 2006). Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the performance of PPD prediction models in cohorts with more specific and narrow time frame definitions of PPD.

The PPD rate in our study cohort is on the lower end of the range reported in the literature (Norhayati et al., 2015). However, this PPD rate is consistent with previously published population-based reports, which also included stringent PPD definitions using clinical diagnoses or antidepressant prescriptions, whereas prospective PPD studies relying on self-reported symptom-based measures are prone to overestimation of PPD rates (Rasmussen et al., 2017; Silverman et al., 2017). Furthermore, it is likely that excluding cases with depression during the 6 months before gestation reduced the PPD rate in our cohort. As a substantial proportion of mild to moderate PPD episodes are often not diagnosed, the PPD definition in our cohort likely captures the moderate-severe cases of PPD who sought professional help, putatively yielding a clinically meaningful outcome definition. Yet, the EHR-derived diagnoses and antidepressant prescriptions used to define the cases of PPD in our cohort may lessen outcome specificity.

This model was built using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm, based on a recent study that found minimal differences in performance between XGBoost and other machine learning algorithms, for EHR-data-based PPD prediction (Wang et al., 2019). It is important, however, to compare this approach to other machine learning algorithms or more interpretable/standard analyses (e.g., LASSO). Ultimately, it should be kept in mind that a machine learning algorithm is a tool supporting the clinician and cannot replace his or her evaluation and judgment.

Despite the study's weaknesses, its large sample size and focus on predictors of new-onset PPD are definitely strengths and constitute a significant contribution to the field.

Development and validation of a meta-learner for combining statistical and machine learning prediction models in individuals with depression,"Background: The debate of whether machine learning models offer advantages over standard statistical methods when making predictions is ongoing. We discuss the use of a meta-learner model combining both approaches as an alternative. Methods: To illustrate the development of a meta-learner, we used a dataset of 187,757 people with depression. Using 31 variables, we aimed to predict two outcomes measured 60 days after initiation of antidepressant treatment: severity of depressive symptoms (continuous) and all-cause dropouts (binary). We fitted a ridge regression and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) deep neural network as two separate prediction models (“base-learners”). We then developed two “meta-learners”, combining predictions from the two base-learners. To compare the performance across the different methods, we calculated mean absolute error (MAE, for continuous outcome) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, for binary outcome) using bootstrapping. Results: Compared to the best performing base-learner (MLP base-learner, MAE at 4.63, AUC at 0.59), the best performing meta-learner showed a 2.49% decrease in MAE at 4.52 for the continuous outcome and a 6.47% increase in AUC at 0.60 for the binary outcome. Conclusions: A meta-learner approach may effectively combine multiple prediction models. Choosing between statistical and machine learning models may not be necessary in practice.  2022, The Author(s).","A prevalent view among practitioners is that statistical methods are more suitable when the number of predictors is relatively small, while machine learning models are more useful for bigger datasets and when non-linear relationships among the predictors and the outcome are suspected [48]. Accordingly, in a recent paper, Austin et al. [17] showed in simulations that in the “large N, small p” setting, statistical learning methods perform well, suggesting that more complicated methods may bring small benefits. Recently, however, there has been a call for an integration of the two approaches, so that they can complement rather than antagonize each other [49]. This paper took a step in this direction. We presented how meta-learners based on ensemble learning can effectively synthesize statistical and machine learning models for predicting continuous or binary outcomes, and potentially improve performance. Thus, our results suggest that choosing between statistical and machine learning models with respect to predictive tasks in the medical domain may not always be necessary.

More specifically, we showed that a meta-learner, even the simplest one, can potentially give better predictive performance than its constituent parts, i.e., the base-learners. As an illustrative example, we used a dataset from patients with depression, where we aimed to predict depression severity and probability of dropping out from antidepressant treatment due to any reason at 60_days. Both outcomes are generally relevant for clinical decision making, i.e., for deciding upon treatment initiation.

In our example, we found that the MLP meta-learner performed slightly better than the linear (logistic) regression meta-learner, for both outcomes in both cases, indicating the MLP meta-learner picked up some nonlinearity from the base-learner predictions. Thus, for better predictive performance, a more advanced meta-learner might be preferable in practice [50]. We also conducted further analyses, where we reused patient-level covariates as additional predictors for the meta-learners (Additional file 1: Table S15). We found that incorporating the patient covariates as additional meta-learner input may potentially further benefit the performance of a meta-learner.

One general limitation of the meta-learners we presented is the increased complexity in terms of model building, which requires expertise in different domains. Moreover, although in our example we saw some increase in performance when using the meta-learners, this gain was clinically insignificant. One possible explanation is that in this dataset the outcomes were mostly linearly dependent on the predictors, so that both statistical and machine learning base-learners utilized the full potential of the dataset, thus not leaving much room for the meta-learners to improve performance. Another reason for the modest gain in performance might be that in terms of stacked generalization, the biggest gains are usually observed when base-learners have high variability, i.e., when they are trapped in different local minimums and generate uncorrelated, diverse predicted values [27]. In our example, however, both base-learners seem to have reached a global minimum, generated optimal performance on their own and predicted broadly similar predictions. One important limitation of this study was that one predictor, namely the PHQ-9 baseline score, had 75% missing values. In this case, multiple imputations might introduce bias and possibly a complete case analysis might have been preferable. We decided, however, not to exclude this predictor from our analysis because it was a priori deemed to be one of the most important patient baseline characteristics. Moreover, excluding patients with missing PHQ-9 baseline scores would considerably reduce our sample size.

Finally, readers should note that in this paper we did not predict relative effects between treatments. This would require having in the dataset patients on different treatments, the inclusion of treatment itself as a predictor in the model, and the use of causal inference methods. Ideally, randomized data should be used for such an aim – although observational data could also be used thanks to methodological advancements in recent years. However, in this paper we did not consider relative treatment effects at all, and we only focused on the case of predicting an absolute outcome.

Conclusion
The proposed meta-learner has the potential to efficiently combine statistical and machine learning models for joint prediction. With appropriate adjustment, the meta-learner may be employed as a handy alternative solution to predictive tasks in the medical domain. As practical advice, we corroborate previous recommendations [51] by suggesting the use of classical statistical methods for most clinical research questions, which typically do not involve large datasets or many potential predictors. Following Occam’s razor, we especially recommend classical methods when there is a prior indication that predictors mainly affect the outcome in an additive manner and when interactions between them can either be prespecified or play a relatively smaller role. Conversely, for larger datasets, and especially when non-additive effects are suspected, researchers can explore both statistical methods and machine learning approaches and follow a meta-learner approach to combine, rather than compare, the two methods. An interesting area of future research is to further explore the performance of meta-learners in simulated datasets and assess their performance on additional real examples.

Early antidepressant treatment response prediction in major depression using clinical and TPH2 DNA methylation features based on machine learning approaches,"Objective: To identify DNA methylation and clinical features, and to construct machine learning classifiers to assign the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) into responders and non-responders after a 2-week treatment into responders and non-responders. Method: Han Chinese patients (291 in total) with MDD comprised the study population. Datasets contained demographic information, environment stress factors, and the methylation levels of 38 methylated sites of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) genes in peripheral blood samples. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to select features. Five classification algorithms (logistic regression, classification and regression trees, support vector machine, logitboost and random forests) were used to establish the models. Performance metrics (AUC, F-Measure, G-Mean, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) were computed with 5-fold-cross-validation. Variable importance was evaluated by random forest algorithm. Result: RF with RFE outperformed the other models in our samples based on the demographic information and clinical features (AUC = 61.2%, 95%CI: 60.1-62.4%) / TPH2 CpGs features (AUC = 66.6%, 95%CI: 65.4-67.8%) / both clinical and TPH2 CpGs features (AUC = 72.9%, 95%CI: 71.8-74.0%). Conclusion: The effects of TPH2 on the early-stage antidepressant response were explored by machine learning algorithms. On the basis of the baseline depression severity and TPH2 CpG sites, machine learning approaches can enhance our ability to predict the early-stage antidepressant response. Some potentially important predictors (e.g., TPH2-10-60 (rs2129575), TPH2-2-163 (rs11178998), age of first onset, age) in early-stage treatment response could be utilized in future fundamental research, drug development and clinical practice.  2023, The Author(s).","Given the phenotypic complexity of the antidepressant response, clinical data are insufficient to guide the treatment selection for each patient [27]. Methylation marks are potential biomarkers reflecting variation within the central nervous system [28] and they are very stable in bio-samples. TPH2 contributes to altered neuronal serotonin (5-HT) function, which are associated with MDD or suicidal behavior. Methylation of CpGs in the TPH2 promoter area affects gene expression [29]. TPH2 is therefore considered as a candidate gene for MDD and the pharmacogenetics of the antidepressant reaction [30]. However, the precise mechanism of the serotonin system in MDD remains to be clarified [31, 32]. In the present study, clinical features and information on TPH2 methylation were gathered to establish prediction models for the early-stage antidepressant response in the Chinese Han population, leading to the identification of important CpGs as potential biomarkers in the early MDD treatment.

The response rate (a 50% reduction of HAMD-17 scores at 2 weeks relative to baseline) is 61.9% in our study. All patients were treated with a single antidepressant appropriate to the clinical indication. Specifically, the antidepressants include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) (n_=_177) and non-SSRIs (n_=_114). The non-SSRIs include serotonin and nor-epinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) (n_=_94), noradrenergic and selective serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSA(s) (n_=_13), and serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARI) (n_=_7). Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers were not used for concomitant treatment, except for a low dose of benzodiazepine anxiolytic for the treatment of insomnia in some cases. In contrast, the response rate reported in the literature is 36.5% for the MDD patients treated with fluoxetine [33]. Our response rate is indeed higher than that described in the literature. The relatively higher response rate in our study is probably caused by: (1) samples that we collected from in-patients who might have received better care and support from clinic staff at the hospital; (2) the baseline HAMD-17 of in-patients was 22.95 in this study, indicating that the symptoms of these in-patients were mild and not refractory; and (3) the patients were discharged at 2 weeks. They might expect to be discharged, which could cause a bias in the evaluation at 2 weeks. The treatment rebound may occur in patients after discharge from the hospital. Lacking follow up is the limitation of this study. This study more focuses on the short-term effect in 2 weeks, from the perspective of machine learning to analyses its impact factors. Additionally, antidepressant drug dosage was adjusted as needed during the study.

Our findings suggest the better prediction performance of the models with the selected features. The prediction model can synergize clinical data with DNA methylation data to improve the prediction power of our classifiers and clinical prognostic evaluation [34]. RF with RFE in this study outperformed the other reported models according to the clinical features (AUC_=_61.2%, 95%CI: 60.1-62.4%) / TPH2 CpGs features (AUC_=_66.6%, 95%CI: 65.4-67.8%) / both clinical and TPH2 CpGs features (AUC_=_72.9%, 95%CI: 71.8-74.0%). Compared with the other three evaluated models, logistic and rpart classifier have the relatively lower values of ROC-AUC and are less accurate. The sensitivity and specificity were associated with optimal threshold. For example, the classifier’s Youden index gets maximum value at a threshold of 0.581, the sensitivity and specificity of RF with RFE based on clinical and TPH2 CpGs features are 0.882 and 0.405. If we reduce threshold, the sensitivity will decrease and the specificity will increase. In our study, the specificities of all models are not high, which means the classifiers are better at identifying likely responders than at identifying likely non-responders. We also chose AUC to represent the performance of models because AUC combines sensitivity and specificity under different thresholds and it is more often to evaluate for model performance.

Encouraged by the good performance of the RF model, we further investigated the contribution from TPH2 methylation. RFE helped us to identify a small subset of discriminative and predictive CpGs in SNP TPH2 sites. These SNP sites with high importance values have been demonstrated to have a connection with neuropsychiatric conditions, and our research results are consistent with those reported data. A recent research has shown that rs2129575 might be a susceptibility gene underlying heroin addiction [35]. A meta-analysis of the studies in BD showed that the fixed summary OR for rs11178998 (1184 cases and 1585 controls) was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.09–1.61) [36]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis showed that TPH2 SNPs rs11178998 is associated with one or more psychopathological conditions [37]. Also, a significant association with schizophrenia for rs10784941 (p_=_0.009, OR minor G-allele 0.82 [0.71–0.95]) was observed in the discovery sample consisting of 788 schizophrenia patients and 688 controls [38]. Moreover, meta-analysis results based on nine SNPs in the TPH2 gene revealed that rs7305115 was associated with suicidal behavior under a fixed effect model [39]. Additionally, rs34115267 was selected into its cohort study due to its risk patterns and processes for psychopathology emerging in adolescence (ROOTS) project [40]. Collectively, in this study, the good performance of ML implied its potential to predict MDD and to assist clinicians in making more objective and efficient decisions. Even though we cannot advocate the applicability of these clinical prediction models at this moment, our study provided the probability of exploring more blood-based biomarkers for MDD prediction, serving as a step towards precision medicine in psychiatry. These predictive SNPs in early-stage treatment response could be utilized in many contexts, such as fundamental research, drug development and clinical practice.

Besides, demographic and clinical variables (e.g., age of first onset, age) were considered important features for early-stage treatment response prediction. Further evidence was provided that age and gender moderate response to antidepressants [41]. In actual statistical analyses, most research on MDD included age and gender as key covariates [42, 43].

However, the following limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. In view of the relatively small sample size, 5-fold CV was employed to avoid overfitting of the models, and future prospective studies utilizing larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm our findings. Also, the following predictors could be selected to reduce the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the early-stage antidepressant response: electroencephalogram (EEG) [44] and environmental factors [45], such as diet, alcohol consumption, stress and smoking status.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the effects of TPH2 on the early-stage antidepressant response was explored by supervised machine learning algorithms. On the basis of the baseline depression severity and the TPH2 CpG sites, machine learning approaches can enhance our ability to predict the early-stage antidepressant response. Some potentially important predictors (e.g., TPH2-10-60(rs2129575), TPH2-2-163(rs11178998), age of first onset, age) in early-stage treatment response could be utilized in future fundamental research, drug development and clinical practice."
Early symptom change contributes to the outcome prediction of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression patients: A machine learning approach,"Background: Limited evidence exists regarding the association between early symptom change and later outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This study aimed to apply machine learning algorithms to predict continuous treatment outcomes based on pre-treatment predictors and early symptom changes and to uncover whether additional variance could be explained compared to regression methods. Additionally, the study examined early subscale symptom changes to determine the most significant predictors of treatment outcome. Methods: We investigated CBT outcomes in a large naturalistic dataset (N = 1975 depression patients). The sociodemographic profile, pre-treatment predictors, and early symptom change, including total and subscale scores were used to predict the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ)48 score at the 10th session as a continuous outcome. Different machine learners were compared to linear regression. Results: Early symptom change and baseline symptom score were the only significant predictors. Models with early symptom change explained 22.0 % to 23.3 % more variance than those without early symptom change. Specifically, the baseline total symptom score, and the early symptom score changes of the subscales pertaining to depression and anxiety were the top three predictors of treatment outcome. Limitation: Excluded patients with missing treatment outcomes had slightly higher symptom scores at baseline, indicating possible selection bias. Conclusion: Early symptom change improved the prediction of treatment outcomes. The prediction performance achieved is far from clinical relevance: the best learner could only explain 51.2 % of the variance in outcomes. Compared to linear regression, more sophisticated preprocessing and learning methods did not substantially improve performance.  2023 The Authors","Early total symptom change in week five contributed substantially to outcome prediction for CBT. The baseline symptom score was also a significant predictor, which might at least partly be attributable to regression toward later outcome prediction. None of the other variables were predictive of treatment outcome in week 10. The prediction performance was far from clinically relevant: the best learner could only explain 51.2 % variance of CBT treatment outcome, which confirms the difficulty of predicting treatment outcomes. The external validation confirmed the findings, but with a slightly lower performance compared to the original results. Typically, external validations exhibit lower performance than reported in cross-validation due to over-calibration, resulting in somewhat reduced transferability to new datasets (Betancur et al., 2019). While other studies used machine learning methods, ours was the first to use it in a routine dataset and include information on early symptom change. Applying more sophisticated preprocessing and learning methods did not substantially improve performance.

With the caveat that overall predictive performance was not extremely high with around 45 % of all variability in outcomes explained by the predictors, the significance of both baseline symptom scores and early total symptom change in predicting outcomes is apparent in various machine learning analysis pipelines. The differential importance of these variables across machine learning pipelines used different metrics including percent increase in mean squared error and total decrease in node impurities, but all pointed in the same direction. One explanation for the predictive power of early symptom change is that patients, who had positive early symptom change, experienced relief of some symptoms and developed hope and an alliance with the therapist. More specifically, our examination of subscale scores yielded findings indicating that changes in scores on subscales associated with depressed mood and anxiety occurred early on, and were predictive of treatment outcomes. Conversely, individuals who do not show early symptom improvement may potentially benefit from increasing the intensity or altering the type of intervention by clinicians.

The advantage of early symptom change over pre-treatment demographics predictors seems quite substantial, which proved that individual demographics were not associated with reported accuracy (Sajjadian et al., 2021). These results were in line with previous studies (Santor and Segal, 2001; Stassen et al., 2007; Szegedi et al., 2003; Tadi_ et al., 2010). Findings were also consistent with studies on other psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia (Samara et al., 2015) and anxiety (Baldwin et al., 2012).

Our findings suggest that a continuous measure of early symptom change is a more effective predictor of treatment outcome compared to a categorical change variable. Specifically, Schindler et al. (2013) reported that a model utilizing categorical early symptom change had an accuracy of 38.9 % in predicting treatment response, whereas in our current study it accounted for 47.1 %–51.2 % of the variance in outcomes. If these findings would indicate not only a predictive, but also causal relationship, therapists could focus on addressing target indicators such as readiness and intensity to potentially enhance early symptom change, which may lead to improved treatment outcomes later on.

The large sample size of this study ensured a high level of statistical power. More importantly, our dataset from a large psychotherapy outpatient center provided information on real-world effectiveness. The study also has several limitations. First, selection bias may have occurred as excluded patients had higher baseline SQ48 scores compared to included patients. Second, we excluded patients who completed the treatment trajectory with fewer than ten sessions, which may have affected the performance of our machine learning algorithms. Third, limited predictors are available in real-world clinical practice; Hence our dataset had relatively few potential predictors. Identifying better ways to predict treatment outcome using additional routinely measured predictive variables is still necessary to ensure the accessibility of treatment by offering more tailored treatment durations.

5. Conclusion
Early total symptom change during the first five weeks was a significant predictor of treatment outcome for CBT in a routine clinical setting, as demonstrated by both linear regression and machine learning pipelines. Interestingly, more sophisticated preprocessing and learning methods did not substantially improve performance. Analysis of changes in subscale scores revealed that improvement in symptoms related to depressed mood and anxiety predicted treatment response, indicating the potential clinical relevance of early symptom monitoring to identify patients who need increased intervention intensity or alteration of treatment type. These routinely measured predictive variables could support better-tailored CBT treatment. However, future research may need to explore alternative sources of information, as the currently available routinely collected data may only explain up to 51.2 % of the total variance in outcomes."
First-onset major depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: A predictive machine learning model,"Background: This study longitudinally evaluated first-onset major depression rates during the pandemic in Italian adults without any current clinician-diagnosed psychiatric disorder and created a predictive machine learning model (MLM) to evaluate subsequent independent samples. Methods: An online, self-reported survey was released during two pandemic periods (May to June and September to October 2020). Provisional diagnoses of major depressive disorder (PMDD) were determined using a diagnostic algorithm based on the DSM criteria of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to maximize specificity. Gradient-boosted decision trees and the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique created the MLM and estimated each variable's predictive contribution. Results: There were 3532 participants in the study. The final sample included 633 participants in the first wave (FW) survey and 290 in the second (SW). First-onset PMDD was found in 7.4% of FW participants and 7.2% of the SW. The final MLM, trained on the FW, displayed a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 77.8% when tested on the SW. The main factors identified in the MLM were low resilience, being an undergraduate student, being stressed by pandemic-related conditions, and low satisfaction with usual sleep before the pandemic and support from relatives. Current smoking and taking medication for medical conditions also contributed, albeit to a lesser extent. Limitations: Small sample size; self-report assessment; data covering 2020 only. Conclusions: Rates of first-onset PMDD among Italians during the first phases of the pandemic were considerable. Our MLM displayed a good predictive performance, suggesting potential goals for depression-preventive interventions during public health crises.  2022 Elsevier B.V.","The study data were obtained from the first (May 18 to June 20, 2020) and second (September 15 to October 20, 2020) waves of an online survey conducted among Italy's general population during the pandemic.

We had two novel aims in our study. First, we estimated first-onset PMDD over the first eight months of the pandemic in Italians who had no clinician-diagnosed CPsyDs. Second, we produced an ML model to predict the emergence of first-onset PMDD in an independent sample of participants in the second wave after it was trained on data from the first wave. The main advantage of using the ML approach was its capability to identify the most relevant potential predictors for first-onset PMDD among a very large array of interrelated individual and psychosocial variables.

4.1. First-onset PMDD
We identified 7.4% of participants in the first wave and a further 7.2% in the second as meeting the criteria for first-onset PMDD. These rates were obtained by applying the DSM-IV criteria-based diagnostic algorithm to self-reported PHQ-9 scores to maximize the specificity of depression screening compared with the use of a score cutoff threshold of ≥10 (He et al., 2020; Spitzer et al., 1999).

Our findings suggest an increase in MDD among the general population of Italy during the pandemic, considering the pre-pandemic estimate of an approximately 3–5% 12-month MDD prevalence in Italy (Girolamo et al., 2006; National Centre for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (CNaPPS), 2019; Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Salute nelle Regioni Italiane, 2019). Likewise, PHQ-based pre-pandemic screenings of depression in the general Italian population provided prevalence rates of 2.5% (Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Salute nelle Regioni Italiane, 2019) and 6% (National Centre for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (CNaPPS), 2019), which were lower than rates we identified during the pandemic. However, those studies did not use the PHQ-9 instrument. Finally, the lack of epidemiological data for Italy concerning the pre-pandemic incidence of MDD prevented us from providing direct pre- versus during- pandemic incidence comparisons.

Considering the shortcomings of the self-report MDD screening relative to the pre-pandemic MDD rates obtained via clinical interviews (Girolamo et al., 2006), our findings pointed to a possible contribution of the pandemic to raising the MDD rates among the Italians.

In most other Italian studies conducted during the pandemic, the rates at which the general population scored above the clinical threshold for self-reported depression were higher than the rates we found, ranging from 20% to 40%, approximately (Bruno et al., 2020; Mazza et al., 2020; Mencacci and Salvi, 2021; Roma et al., 2020). This discrepancy may have been due to the use of different psychometric tools or the application of the PHQ-9 cutoff score threshold, which produces higher sensitivity but lower specificity in detecting a major depressive episode than the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm that we used (He et al., 2020; Spitzer et al., 1999). Finally, we were specifically interested in the first onset of primary MDD, we excluded participants with CPsyDs and past major depression, but the comparison studies were more inclusive. Therefore, the higher depression rates identified in previous Italian studies may have included depressive conditions before the pandemic, were secondary to other current psychiatric disorders, or were recurrent depression in previously remitted people. Similar factors, in addition to social and cultural differences, may explain the higher rates of self-reported depression that were found in most other studies worldwide (Adu et al., 2021; Cénat et al., 2021; Ettman et al., 2020; Hao et al., 2020; Lakhan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a, Liu et al., 2020b; Luo et al., 2020; Salari et al., 2020; Solomou and Constantinidou, 2020; Wu et al., 2021).

Bearing all these factors in mind, it seems that the rates of first-onset PMDD among Italians during the COVID-19 pandemic deserve consideration.

4.2. ML predictive model
Our final best ML predictive model incorporated ten variables and displayed a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 77.8% when tested during the second wave, suggesting a good prediction performance for first-onset PMDD in independent samples of Italians during the pandemic. These results suggest that the same variables that had contributed to the emergence of first-onset PMDD at the beginning of the pandemic may have continued to affect Italians even in the following months. Participants in the two waves significantly differed in some of the 46 variables used as potential predictors, possibly due to changes in pandemic-related conditions and situations over time. However, the good performance of the algorithm in the second wave makes it highly unlikely that changes in the distribution of variables between the first and the second wave may have significantly affected the predictive capability of the algorithm.

The largest contributions to the prediction among the model's variables came from individual features that preceded the pandemic, namely low “ability to bounce back or recover from” setbacks or stressful events, being an undergraduate student, and being unsatisfied with usual sleep before the pandemic. Two other factors directly related to the pandemic were highly perceived stress regarding the possibility of spreading the infection to others and in response to measures restricting personal activities and movement. A lower but significant contribution was also provided by the pre-pandemic dispositional perception of being poorly supported by relatives or household members in facing difficulties. Finally, being an active smoker, including continuing a pre-existing smoking habit or starting smoking during the pandemic, and taking medications for medical disease treatment contributed to the prediction, although to a more limited extent than the other predictors. “Having experienced a loved one's hospitalization” displayed the smallest average contribution, playing only a marginal role in the model.

Our results are consistent with other findings around the world that find low resilience is a risk factor for poorer mental health outcomes in the general population, including depressive symptoms, after wide-scale stressors, such as natural disasters (Blackmon et al., 2017; Osofsky et al., 2011; Shenesey and Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2015), and the COVID-19 pandemic (Landi et al., 2020; Lenzo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Prout et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021). Our previous work has identified low resilience as a predictive factor in developing different new-onset psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic among Italians with no psychiatric history (Caldirola et al., 2022). Although different resilience assessment questionnaires have been used in different studies, overall results support the idea that low resilience may be a non-specific vulnerability factor in different psychiatric disorders, including depression, following exposure to severe stressors, such as the ongoing pandemic. However, resilience is currently conceptualized as a complex and dynamic quality, including multiple resilience factors that range from neurobiological and psychological features of the individual to the social context and relationship networks (Ayed et al., 2019; Kageyama et al., 2021; Kalisch et al., 2019; Perna et al., 2020; Roeckner et al., 2021). In line with this, we also found that preceding low levels of support by relatives or household members in difficult situations was as an additional significant predictor of first-onset PMDD. Because we used a single resilience questionnaire that only explores a specific aspect of this complex construct, future studies with broader resilience assessments may identify other resilience factors relevant to mental health during large-scale, long-lasting stressful events.

Being an undergraduate student was the only occupational status relevant to the predictive model. This finding supports and broadens previous findings in different countries of higher pandemic-related depressive symptoms among students than in other employment groups (González-Sanguino et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020; Olagoke et al., 2020). It is also consistent with the multiple reports of substantial rates of psychiatric symptoms and disorders among university students that have been published during the COVID-19 pandemic (Caldirola et al., 2022; Dogan-Sander et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; McLafferty et al., 2021). Several pandemic-related changes affected students' mental well-being, including difficulty adjusting to online classes, self-regulated learning, and self-motivation, as well as daily physical isolation, concerns about decreased practical learning experience, perceived increases in university workload, and worry regarding capacity to successfully meet academic criteria (Conceição et al., 2021; Dogan-Sander et al., 2021; Guse et al., 2021; Matos Fialho et al., 2021). These student-specific stressors might have influenced the occurrence of first-onset PMDD in this particular population subgroup, considering that the younger population is usually more vulnerable to depression than the older people (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Therefore, strategies to improve students' mental well-being during the ongoing pandemic or future crises should be implemented at universities, including psychological and educational support and resilience programs (Akeman et al., 2020).

Low satisfaction with usual sleep before the pandemic contributed to the prediction of first-onset PMDD. This finding is consistent with longitudinal studies that identified sleep complaints or disorders in non-depressed people as a significant risk factor for later development of depression (Baglioni et al., 2011; Byrne et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2016; Nutt et al., 2008). Hence, a personal sleep-related vulnerability to depression might have contributed to the emergence of first-onset PMDD in a portion of the population under pandemic-associated stressful conditions. Public awareness campaigns of the importance of satisfactory sleep to mental health, including education on sleep hygiene and easy-to-implement strategies to develop favourable sleep habits and manage insomnia, might help prevent depression in vulnerable people during a global crisis.

Two other important predictive variables for first-onset PMDD were the higher levels of perceived stress regarding common pandemic-related issues, namely the possibility of transmitting COVID-19 to others and the restriction of personal autonomy. We previously showed the same variables are significant predictors of different new-onset psychiatric disorders among Italians during the pandemic (Caldirola et al., 2022). Thus, the subjective emotional responses to unexpected stressors may potentially be non-specific risk factors for developing mental disorders, including MDD. Even though decreasing personal hyperactivity to stressful issues would require psychological treatment, more vulnerable people might benefit from supportive public campaigns to manage related difficulties during public health crises.

The contribution of active smoking to our predictive model is in line with findings for smoking as a potential risk factor for depression, which has multiple possible mechanisms, including oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, neural damage, and neurotransmission impairment (Hahad et al., 2021). Therefore, strengthening information campaigns regarding smoking's detrimental effects on mental health and encouraging people to decrease or not to start smoking, especially under highly stressful conditions, could play a part in counteracting the development depression during public emergencies.

Finally, our finding that taking medication for medical diseases is a predictor for first-onset PMDD is consistent with the well-known bidirectional association between physical illnesses and depression (Roohi et al., 2021; Thom et al., 2019). Although further confirmation is needed, self-reported medication use for physical diseases may be a more reliable proxy for the presence of true medical conditions relative to self-reported medical diagnoses. Our finding suggests that careful mental health monitoring may be called for among people with medical diseases during large-scale stressful events.

Sex did not contribute to the prediction of first-onset PMDD. It seems unexpected due to the usual higher prevalence of MDD among women relative to men (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although a large part of participants in our study were women, the ML technique we used was suitable to take into account this sex distribution imbalance without an expected significant impact on the identification of sex as a relevant predictor. Our result may be explained by the use of the MRMR technique to maximize the relevance of each variable to the outcome of interest and minimize its redundancy among a large array of interrelated variables. Therefore, being female may be individually associated with a higher risk of depression onset, but it may have been excluded from the final predictive ML model because it was associated with and redundant relative to other variables highly relevant to the model. In line with this, gender is not relevant to the prediction of PHQ-9 score cutoff threshold of ≥10 during the pandemic also in the only other study that used an ML approach (Prout et al., 2020).

The same reason may partly explain our finding that having had a clinician-diagnosed psychiatric disorder only in the past is not a predictor of first-onset PMDD. This finding may also suggest that a personal vulnerability to other psychiatric disorders does not necessarily confer an increased risk of first-onset PMDD in the general population, at least under the conditions analyzed in this study.

4.3. Strengths and limitations of this study
The strengths of this study include the use of an ML approach, which is particularly suitable for developing a predictive model among large and complex data sets, and the application of the SHAP technique, which allowed us to identify the importance of each variable for the prediction. It should be noted that these characteristics of the ML approach make it remarkably promising for future studies in the psychiatric field, considering that psychiatric disorders are highly complex conditions, involving an interplay of multiple individual, environmental, and genetic features and risk factors.

Finally, the longitudinal design of this study enabled us to recognize a set of variables that continue to exert their influence on first-onset PMDD for two periods of the pandemic.

Likewise, some limitations are present. The sample size was limited due to the restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Probably due to the involvement of official institutional sites in the recruitment, most participants were from north-western Italy. Hence, we were unable to include geographical distribution as a potential predictor in the model. Considering that sociodemographic and economic differences across the country exist, and north-western Italy has been particularly affected by the COVID-19, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, that limitation can make our results not applicable to the general population of Italy.

The rates of CPsyDs and past major depression, which were exclusion criteria in this study, were particularly high, suggesting that participants in our study may be not representative of the entire general Italian population. All participants in the survey were ≥18 years, so no data were collected on younger people. The self-report nature of the entire survey cannot exclude inaccuracy or subjective bias among participants, even concerning the main inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as psychiatric history. Indeed, we cannot exclude that people who reported not to have CPsyDs, or not to have had past major depression, could have had undiagnosed psychiatric conditions, representing a relevant limitation of the study. Likewise, although we used the most conservative method of MDD self-assessment available, we could not exclude the consideration that at least part of the PHQ-9-based first-onset PMDDs was not related to true clinical MDD diagnoses. Because our survey explored a large array of variables with multiple questionnaires, we simplified the evaluation of each variable, so in depth-details on several personal features, experiences, and behaviors were lacking. Moreover, due to the length of the survey and the high probability that information on some specific topics was unreliable, we did not include questions concerning other known vulnerability factors, such as childhood trauma or family history for depression, which have a predictive value for first-onset MDD in a pre-pandemic algorithm developed in the US general population (Wang et al., 2014). Finally, our predictive model is based on data that only covers 2020. However, the pandemic is still ongoing. The global scenario has partly changed, including the administration of vaccines and a substantial decrease of restrictions on activities and personal movement in the general Italian population.

Further prospective studies should use data from the later pandemic phases in 2021 to assess the course of depression, test the model's validity, and explore whether other predictive factors may have played a part in first-onset PMDD.

4.4. Conclusions
This study identified considerable rates of first-onset PMDD during the first eight months of the pandemic among Italian adults without CPsyDs and developed an ML model with a good predictive capability in two independent samples.

The model's predictive variables could be used to develop goals for preventive interventions during the ongoing pandemic or future public health crises, to decrease depression risk among the general population.

Lifestyle predictors of depression and anxiety during COVID-19: a machine learning approach,"Introduction: Recent research has suggested an increase in the global prevalence of psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess whether lifestyle behaviors can predict the presence of depression and anxiety in the Brazilian general population, using a model developed in Spain. Methods: A web survey was conducted during April-May 2020, which included the Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation (SMILE) scale, assessing lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression and anxiety were examined using the PHQ-2 and the GAD-7, respectively. Elastic net, random forest, and gradient tree boosting were used to develop predictive models. Each technique used a subset of the Spanish sample to train the models, which were then tested internally (vs. the remainder of the Spanish sample) and externally (vs. the full Brazilian sample), evaluating their effectiveness. Results: The study sample included 22,562 individuals (19,069 from Brazil, and 3,493 from Spain). The models developed performed similarly and were equally effective in predicting depression and anxiety in both tests, with internal test AUC-ROC values of 0.85 (depression) and 0.86 (anxiety), and external test AUC-ROC values of 0.85 (depression) and 0.84 (anxiety). Meaning of life was the strongest predictor of depression, while sleep quality was the strongest predictor of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusions: Specific lifestyle behaviors during the early COVID-19 epidemic successfully predicted the presence of depression and anxiety in a large Brazilian sample using machine learning models developed on a Spanish sample. Targeted interventions focused on promoting healthier lifestyles are encouraged.  2022, Sociedade de Psiquiatria do Rio Grande do Sul.

Additionally, the results highlight the importance of different lifestyle factors and general self-concerns as predictors of these disorders, with perception about meaning of life, self-rated health, and use of sleeping pills being the most important predictors of depression, and restful sleep, use of sleeping pills, and perception about work-life balance being the most important predictors of anxiety.

The COVID-19 epidemic started at different times in Spain and Brazil, where the population of Spain was affected by the first wave of the contagious virus prior to escalation of the outbreak in the Brazilian population. By assessing lifestyle behaviors in the early stages of the epidemic in Spain using a multidimensional lifestyle questionnaire (SMILE), we developed predictive models with three different machine learning methods using a subset of the Spanish sample. The models were then tested internally (with the remaining subset of the Spanish sample) and later tested externally with the full Brazilian sample. The consistency in performance metrics between the different methods, as well as the similarities between the internal and external tests suggest that the internally developed models were able to predict the presence of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the external set, which is the main, novel finding from this research study.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop machine learning models in one country that are equally effective in predicting the presence of common mental health disorders in a different country. Implications from this study indicate that elastic net, random forest, and XGBoost are reliable techniques for transnational prediction of common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. The cross-fertilization of independent analyses carried out in different contexts is a much-desired goal of contemporary epistemology, decision science, and computer science, among other fields of knowledge. Prior literature has found many similarities in lifestyle factors that correlate to presence of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in underdeveloped, developing, and developed countries.23,24 Recent studies conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak have also indicated higher prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in the general population during this period.25,26 Considering the severe consequences of the pandemic in highly affected countries such as Brazil and Spain, a recent study conducted in these regions found an association between unhealthy lifestyle changes and presence of depression and anxiety among essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.16 With this in mind, taking into consideration the similarities across different countries in lifestyle adversities due to the COVID-19 crisis, it is possible that the models developed and used in this study may be able to reliably capture predictive factors of the presence of common mental disorders in different regions of the world.

We also assessed the importance of each lifestyle variable on the SMILE scale as independent factors associated with presence of depression and anxiety using machine learning methods. We used the Spain training sample to evaluate the importance of each independent question in predicting presence of the mental disorders of interest. Intriguingly, we found the answers to the question, “Do you feel that your life has a meaning?” to be the predictor most associated with presence of depression. Prior studies have reported an inverse relationship between self-perceived meaning of life and symptoms of depression, concurring with the current findings of our study.27,28 However, we believe this to be the first study indicating that perception of meaning of life carries greater significance in predicting symptoms of depression than other lifestyle factors. The high importance factor seen in this variable could be due to the cumulative contribution of many different aspects of lifestyle towards a sense that life is meaningless during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-rated health was the second most important predictor of presence of depression in this sample during the pandemic, with prior literature also suggesting a strong association between subjective well-being and symptoms of depression.29,30 Among the rest of the factors, sleep medications and sleep quality were found to be among the strongest predictors of depression, which has also been suggested in previous findings.31,32

Furthermore, we assessed the importance of each lifestyle variable on the SMILE scale as independent predictors of anxiety in the Spanish training sample. The leading, most significant predictor of presence of anxiety was the answer to the question, “In the last month, how often do you feel rested with the number of hours you sleep?”. Similarly, the second most important predictor was related to daily use of sleeping medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is known that sleep disturbances and anxiety are bidirectionally associated,33 and this association was expectedly evident during the early stages of the pandemic.34 Stressful life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which threaten one’s psychological and physical well-being are likely to cause increased sleep disturbances in the population.35 Indeed, sleep problems have been highly prevalent during COVID-19, with approximately 40% of the general population reporting poor sleep quality in the early stages of the pandemic.36 The confinement period during the pandemic has led to changes in social and environmental cues important for circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle, including the lack of fixed schedules for working, eating, exercising, socializing, and similar daily routines.35 Changes in the sleep-wake cycle can result in desynchronization between the circadian rhythm and important immune functions, which can affect a person’s physical and mental well-being.35,37 In particular, reduced sleep quality was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms early on during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy.38 Similarly, our findings indicate that sleep disturbances may be the most important factor in predicting presence of anxiety in the general population in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, perception of work-life balance, meaning of life, and consumption of fast food were other variables from the SMILE scale related to the presence of anxiety, corresponding with previous studies indicating associations between these variables and anxiety.39-41

Findings from our study could have essential clinical implications for clinical professionals and researchers around the world. Considering the effectiveness of our models across different countries, the method developed could be adapted and used across a vast number of countries, especially when countries are in similar situations such as during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first study using machine learning methods to predict which lifestyle behaviors are able to accurately indicate positive screening for depression and anxiety, two of the most common mental disorders globally. Observing the most prevalent lifestyle behaviors among people with depression and anxiety using this model could be the first step towards creating a protocol of targeted interventions addressing unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that increase the likelihood of presence of these symptoms, such as sleep hygiene.

The main limitation of our study is the cross-sectional design. Considering that the lifestyle behaviors (predictors) and the presence of depression/anxiety symptoms (outcomes) were assessed at the same point in time, inference of a causal relationship between the variables is limited. Instead, it depicts a snapshot of a very dynamic process (comprising both the dynamics of the epidemic itself and how people cope with the challenges it poses over time). Furthermore, it is important to highlight that presence of anxiety and depression was assessed using a screening test, and replication of this data assessing them using a structured, albeit much more labor-intensive, clinical interview is encouraged. There are also limitations regarding the lack of fine-tuning of the model for the Brazilian sample; although we showed that the model performs similarly in both countries, the model was not further trained on a subset of Brazilian data, which could potentially improve the model for that sample. In contrast, a major advantage of this study is the consistency in performance metrics across three highly reliable machine learning methods for development of predictive models, which also achieved high AUC-ROC values for the internal and external tests. In addition, another major advantage is that the trained sample of the model was from Spain, one of the first countries affected by the pandemic, which was then tested in Brazil, where the epidemic started at a later period. This is an encouraging sign for development of prevention guides using this model. Lastly, the findings from this paper are in accordance with previous research indicating important mental health burdens related to lifestyle behaviors, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Implications from this study could be highly significant in the approach towards developing targeted approaches to promote healthy lifestyles that might help reducing the burden of common mental disorders."
Machine learning approaches for integrating clinical and imaging features in late-life depression classification and response prediction,"Objective Currently, depression diagnosis relies primarily on behavioral symptoms and signs, and treatment is guided by trial and error instead of evaluating associated underlying brain characteristics. Unlike past studies, we attempted to estimate accurate prediction models for late-life depression diagnosis and treatment response using multiple machine learning methods with inputs of multi-modal imaging and non-imaging whole brain and network-based features. Methods Late-life depression patients (medicated post-recruitment) (n = 33) and older non-depressed individuals (n = 35) were recruited. Their demographics and cognitive ability scores were recorded, and brain characteristics were acquired using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging pretreatment. Linear and nonlinear learning methods were tested for estimating accurate prediction models. Results A learning method called alternating decision trees estimated the most accurate prediction models for late-life depression diagnosis (87.27% accuracy) and treatment response (89.47% accuracy). The diagnosis model included measures of age, Mini-mental state examination score, and structural imaging (e.g. whole brain atrophy and global white mater hyperintensity burden). The treatment response model included measures of structural and functional connectivity. Conclusions Combinations of multi-modal imaging and/or non-imaging measures may help better predict late-life depression diagnosis and treatment response. As a preliminary observation, we speculate that the results may also suggest that different underlying brain characteristics defined by multi-modal imaging measures - rather than region-based differences - are associated with depression versus depression recovery because to our knowledge this is the first depression study to accurately predict both using the same approach. These findings may help better understand late-life depression and identify preliminary steps toward personalized late-life depression treatment. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","In this study, we showed how nonlinear combinations of multi-modal MRI and/or non-imaging measures can successfully estimate prediction models for diagnosis (87.27% accuracy) and treatment response (89.47% accuracy) of LLD. The optimal prediction models for both outcome variables were strikingly distinct in nature with no overlap of selected features. Additionally, the diagnosis prediction model was network-independent, whereas the treatment response prediction model depended on information from the dDMN and aSN. In the succeeding text, we evaluate our findings further using past studies for comparison.
Optimal predictors/biomarkers
Late-life depression diagnosis versus treatment response prediction models

Non-imaging (i.e. Mini-mental state examination and age) and global volume-based imaging (i.e. whole brain atrophy and global WMH burden) measures combined were found to be the optimal predictors/biomarkers of LLD diagnosis. Agreeing with past studies, poor cognitive ability (Ganguli et al., 2006; Wilkins et al., 2009; Kohler et al., 2010b;) and/or greater whole brain atrophy (Chang et al., 2011; Ribeiz et al., 2013; Sexton et al., 2013) indicated LLD. Possibly explaining the discrepancies between past studies, age (Luppa et al., 2012; Wild et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012; Forlani et al., 2013;) and global WMH burden (Greenwald et al., 1998; Gunning-Dixon et al., 2010; Teodorczuk et al., 2010; Aizenstein et al., 2011; Firbank et al., 2012) were fully dependent on the other measures in regard to their association with LLD diagnosis. We speculate that the primary role of non-imaging measures in predicting diagnosis suggests that current neuroimaging methods cannot—yet—capture the neural complexity associated with the etiopathogenesis of LLD. The involvement of structure-related neural biomarkers (global atrophy and WM burden) in diagnosing LLD supports past studies that suggest vascular and atrophic changes trigger mood disorder in late life (Aizenstein et al., 2014).

Contrarily, for LLD treatment response, connectivity-based imaging measures were found to be the optimal biomarkers. Specifically, lower structural connectivity—supported by the more recent of the two (Taylor et al., 2008) contradicting past findings (Alexopoulos et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2008)—and lower functional connectivity—supporting compensation theories (Stern, 2003)—indicate a greater probability of treatment remission. This dependency of LLD treatment response on global network health (i.e. communication strength between network regions) may serve as a biomarker for future personalized care studies. A potential interdependence between biomarkers may explain the contradictions in results between past studies and the heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of LLD patients suggested by Taylor et al, (2008).

Overall, the mix of features predictive of diagnosis likely reflects that LLD is heterogeneous. Our observation that these particular features were not predictive of treatment response suggests that there may be a more proximal mediator of depression recovery, and perhaps the features reflecting LLD heterogeneity lead to a set of global network changes (indexed by rs-fMRI and DTI). It is intriguing that these global network biomarkers were identified as most predictive of treatment response.
Mid-life versus late-life depression prediction models

Unlike past studies of depression in younger populations involving prediction models, this is the first study to accurately model both diagnosis and treatment response using the same approach. While past studies have used a single imaging modality and region-based approach (Fu et al., 2008; Marquand et al., 2008; Costafreda et al., 2009; Hahn et al., 2011; Nouretdinov et al., 2011; Mwangi et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2012b; Mwangi et al., 2012b; Zeng et al., 2012), we used a multi-modal imaging with whole brain and network-based approach that also included non-imaging measures. Our results may suggest that biomarkers of disease diagnosis and remission possibly differ on the basis of brain structure and function—that is, the different representations of MRI modalities—as opposed to brain regions. It is possible that regional changes do not fully reflect the underlying neural vulnerabilities associated with LLD. This is supported by recent studies (Ajilore et al., 2014; Tadayonnejad and Ajilore, 2014) that describe associations of global brain networks alterations with LLD.

Past prediction model studies of mid-life depression diagnosis have shown accurate classifications can be obtained using functional (Fu et al., 2008; Marquand et al., 2008; Hahn et al., 2011; Nouretdinov et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2012) or structural (Costafreda et al., 2009; Mwangi et al., 2012a; Mwangi et al., 2012b) imaging. Our study in LLD found structural volume-based measures in conjunction to non-imaging measures to be better predictors. We speculate that these differences in prediction factors may suggest that LLD diagnosis is primarily related to impaired structure (gray matter and WM), whereas midlife depression may stem from aberrant communication/activation of various brain regions. This hypothesis will require further testing.

Past prediction model studies of mid-life depression treatment response have primarily utilized T1-weighted Hi-Res structural imaging measures (Costafreda et al., 2009; Nouretdinov et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012b). One study (Marquand et al., 2008) that attempted to use a task-based functional imaging measure did not achieve very high accuracy. Our study in LLD found structural and functional connectivity measures to be better predictors. Because connectivity-related imaging measures have not been tested for prediction models of mid-life depression treatment response, it is difficult to draw any conclusions.
Learning methods

Based on our findings, modified versions of decision tree and logistic regression are potential alternative learning methods—to the traditionally used SVM—for prediction depression, particularly in late-life diagnosis and treatment response. Modified decision tree methods with embedded feature selection capabilities, especially, may be useful for studying real-world nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional (i.e. large number of features) data.
Limitations and future work

Limitations to this study include small subsample size for treatment response prediction (nevertheless, the results were cross checked using four different learning methods), varying sample sizes for the different network analysis (this prevents us from accurately analyzing network-based effects and may be causing feature set 13 results to vary across networks despite its network-independent features), higher percentage of women (reflecting the naturalistic gender distribution in LLD (Luppa et al., 2012)), and lack of other potential cognitive ability measures and covariates (due to limited available data). Another limitation is the heterogeneous treatment. However, this may not have affected our LLD treatment response prediction results because all administered antidepressants are either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and the efficacy difference between the two is still a matter of debate (Taylor and Doraiswamy, 2004; Taylor et al., 2006; Papakostas et al., 2007; Thase et al., 2011). Future work includes extensive studies verifying, improving as necessary, and testing the real-world applicability of the optimal prediction models found in our study. It would also be beneficial to test other imaging and non-imaging (e.g. cognitive ability, medical comorbidities, and covariates) measures as potential biomarkers. Potential clinical applications may include using machine learning and imaging to predict treatment efficacy and recommend personalized treatment for LLD. While diagnosis of LLD is not a potential application, the prediction model for LLD diagnosis can help us gain a better understanding of LLD and consequently lead to a better model for predicting treatment response.

Machine learning based prediction of depression among type 2 diabetic patients,"Most of humankind feel sadness, tragic, feeling down from time to time; a few people encounter these emotions strongly, for long period of time and usually with no evident reason. Depression is not a low mood only; it's a genuine condition that affects the physical and mental health of the human. There are many studies that demonstrate a close association between depression and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, this paper aims to consolidate prediction of depression operation through the developing and applying the machine learning techniques. The supervised machine learning aims to construct a compact model of the allocation of class labels based on set of features to mimic the reality. The classification technique is used to give class labels to the subjects under testing based on values of the known prediction features, but the class label is unknown. In this paper state of art supervised learning classifiers have been used with modification to the used data. The results are very encouraging to use machine learning in the Prediction of Depression among Type 2 Diabetic Patients.","In the general diabetic population, it is difficult task to assess the possible medical care requirements and public health loads of depression [16].

In spite of the high impact of depression and diabetes on the individual simultaneously and its significance as a public health issue, however little work had been done in recognition of depression incidence to type 2 diabetic patients in general. Here we presents a new work based on identification the most accurate machine learning techniques used in prediction of depression in type 2 diabetic patients.

The four classifiers were applied to compare the accuracy level of them. Table 4 demonstrates the gained outcomes through experimenting four classifiers on same dataset:

Given the results obtained in Table 4, we can compare the accuracy measure among four kinds of classifiers; the best results indicated that SVM outperforms the others. The following diagram shows the variance of the results when comparing the four algorithms. "
Machine learning models for predicting depression in Korean young employees,"Background: The incidence of depression among employees has gradually risen. Previous studies have focused on predicting the risk of depression, but most studies were conducted using basic statistical methods. This study used machine learning algorithms to build models that detect and identify the important factors associated with depression in the workplace. Methods: A total of 503 employees completed an online survey that included questionnaires on general characteristics, physical health, job-related factors, psychosocial protective, and risk factors in the workplace. The dataset contained 27 predictor variables and one dependent variable which referred to the status of employees (normal or at the risk of depression). The prediction accuracy of three machine learning models using sparse logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest was compared with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Additionally, the important factors identified via sparse logistic regression and random forest. Results: All machine learning models demonstrated similar results, with the lowest accuracy obtained from sparse logistic regression and support vector machine (86.8%) and the highest accuracy from random forest (88.7%). The important factors identified in this study were gender, physical health, job, psychosocial protective factors, and psychosocial risk and protective factors in the workplace. Discussion: The results of this study indicated the potential of machine learning models to accurately predict the risk of depression among employees. The identified factors that influence the risk of depression can contribute to the development of intelligent mental healthcare systems that can detect early signs of depressive symptoms in the workplace. Copyright  2023 Kim, Gil and Min.","This study provides evidence that the ML algorithms can help reduce bias and accurately predict the likelihood of depression among MZ employees. The main strength of this study was the use of the MZ employees’ dataset to predict and identify personal and work-related factors of depression using ML techniques. MZ employees exhibited unique depression symptoms, such as narcissistic tendencies, a feeling of victimization from supervisors, difficulty accepting criticism, and an inferiority complex (46). Our study applied to advanced ML techniques to improve intelligent mental healthcare systems which will be used to detect early depressive symptoms and increase access to mental health services for MZ employees in Korea.

The primary objective of this study is to develop ML algorithms to predict the risk of depression among MZ employees. This objective differs from hypothesis testing, which seeks statistically effective variables in relationship with response variables. In this case, too small sample size leads to low power of the test, which means inefficient use of resources including data and time. To overcome the problem, often optimal sample size calculation for getting enough power based on the expected type I and II error of hypothesis test can be conducted (47). This approach can be wildly found in randomized control trials (RCT), especially clinical trials.

On the other hands, our study is focused on developing the predictive model, and we assess their performance using several prediction performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity. To assess the generalizability of their prediction power, ML typically uses partial portion of the data called the training dataset, and test their prediction performance using the data unused for the model construction, called the test dataset. The test set is used to get the accuracy of the ML algorithms and assess model performance regardless of sample size (10, 48). This approach enables us to estimate a prediction error (generalizability) on new data. In our study, the dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%). Also, cross-validation method the we employed for ML model training is one of the representative devised method to overcome the situation with not enough sample size situation.

Machine learning techniques, sparse logistic regression, SVM, and RF, were applied to develop models for predicting the risk of depression among MZ employees. In this study, sparse logistic regression, SVM, and RF techniques yielded very close accuracies, with RF being slightly higher. Feature selection performed using sparse logistic regression and RF showed similar variables as the important factors of the risk of depression. Sparse logistic Regression provided interpretable results via feature selection procedure with the estimated effect size and p-values for testing its significance, while RF gives a comprehensive view of variable importance through impurity reduction (49, 50). SVM also showed comparable prediction performance, but also limitation of the method is clear that it does not yields any results regarding importance of each feature for prediction. The important variables identified by Sparse logistic Regression and RF could be useful as a selection tool for mental health professionals to identify employees at risk of depression.

We found that female employees were more likely to suffer from depression than male employees. This result in consistent with previous studies which reported higher levels of depression among female employees (51–53). Although the mechanisms that underlie this gender difference remain unclear, one possible explanation is related to sex-specific factors. A reduction in estrogen levels may contribute to an increased risk of depression among women (54). Moreover, female employees in East Asia face heavier domestic workloads, including housework and childcare than males, which may contribute to their depression (2, 55). These results highlight the need to identify the mechanisms underlying depression among female employees and develop tailored interventions to address their needs.

Our finding indicates that employees who sleep less than six hours per night were at a higher risk of depression than those who sleep for more than six hours. This is consistent with previous studies which reported that short sleep was associated with a performance of works and depression (56, 57). Our result suggests that adequate sleep is crucial for preventing depression among employees. Additionally, smokers were more likely to suffer from depression than non-smokers in this study. This result was consistent with previous studies that depression was associated with current smoking (58, 59). Chronic nicotine exposure can affect neurotransmitters such as dopamine and 5-HT, leading to depression (60, 61). To successfully prevent the risk of young employees’ depression, smoking cessation and preventive interventions must be developed.

In our study, occupational stress and burnout were identified as psychosocial risk factors in the workplace pivotal in predicting depression risk in young generation employees. These findings were in similar with the results from prior studies, which reported that work-related stress was associated with higher depression in employees (4, 62). A logistic regression analysis also showed that higher occupational stress from highly demanding jobs were more likely to lead to depression. However, employees whose years of job experience were longer and weekly work hours were between 40 to 52_h showed a lower risk of depression. A potential explanation is that employees who face high job demands such as high workloads, time pressure, and long working hours may tend to develop the risk of depression by feeling hopelessness and powerlessness at work when they have little or no control over their work (63–66).

Moreover, higher burnout from emotional impairment was a predictor in both Logistic Regression and RF approach. This supports the results of previous studies showing that individuals with major depressive disorder struggle with regulating emotions due to a dysfunction of their emotional brain systems (67, 68). This result can be explained that employees who experience difficulty in understanding, recognizing, and controlling emotions may undergo decreased contextual information and memory processing that subsequently impairs the autonomic nervous system and brain structure, which results in depression (67, 69, 70). Consistent with this notion, an emotional regulation program such as mindfulness and Emotional Focused Therapy (EFT) is needed to prevent young employees’ depression.

We discovered a social problem-solving style and meaning in work as significant psychosocial protective factors in the workplace for predicting employees’ depression. According to earlier studies, the deterioration of social problem-solving was associated with depression (71). Negative interpretations of the work environment and events tend to be likely to increase depressive rumination as individuals recall more negative past experiences. In contrast, a greater sense of meaning in work predicted lower depression and higher psychological well-being. Employees who have a desire to help others and contribute to society experienced fewer symptoms of depression (72, 73). To reduce depression, intervention can help MZ employees view their work as meaningful, understand challenges, and develop abilities to deal with stress and difficulties at work.

Three psychosocial protective factors, including attachment, interpersonal relationships, and satisfaction in life, were identified in predicting depression in young employees. Young employees with fearful attachments were more likely to become depressed, while young employees with interpersonal openness were less likely to become depressed. Employees with fearful attachment likely have a negative view of themselves and others causing social isolation and loneliness, but those who are confident in self-expression and have higher self-esteem feel socially connected to others which results in preventing depression (74, 75).

The current study has some limitations. First, cross-sectional data restricts the interpretation of causal relationships. Secondly, the sample was limited to young Korean young employees, making it difficult to generalize to older employees, those at different career stages, and individuals from other cultural backgrounds. Finally, the RF approach identified several important predictive factors, but the direction of effect is unclear.

Conclusion
With advances in data science technology, this study demonstrated the practical applicability of ML algorithms in predicting the risk of depression among MZ employees. We applied three different ML algorithms – sparse logistic regression, RF, and SVM. We found the highest accuracy of RF. Our study identified the important variables influencing the risk of depression among Korean employees such as gender, inadequate sleep, smoking habits, occupational stress, burnout, social problem-solving styles, sense of meaning at work, attachment, interpersonal relationships, and satisfaction in life. These findings contribute to the development of intelligent mental healthcare systems for the early detection of depression. Additionally, our study can help develop target interventions designed to prevent employees’ depression and provide a situation-specific theory that predict depression among MZ employees. However, this study focuses solely on MZ employees, and thus, careful consideration is recommended before generalizing these findings to other demographic groups.

Machine learning models for predicting risk of depression in Korean college students: Identifying family and individual factors,"Background: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses among college students worldwide. Using the family triad dataset, this study investigated machine learning (ML) models to predict the risk of depression in college students and identify important family and individual factors. Methods: This study predicted college students at risk of depression and identified significant family and individual factors in 171 family data (171 fathers, mothers, and college students). The prediction accuracy of three ML models, sparse logistic regression (SLR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), was compared. Results: The three ML models showed excellent prediction capabilities. The RF model showed the best performance. It revealed five significant factors responsible for depression: self-perceived mental health of college students, neuroticism, fearful-avoidant attachment, family cohesion, and mother's depression. Additionally, the logistic regression model identified five factors responsible for depression: the severity of cancer in the father, the severity of respiratory diseases in the mother, the self-perceived mental health of college students, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. Discussion: These findings demonstrated the ability of ML models to accurately predict the risk of depression and identify family and individual factors related to depression among Korean college students. With recent developments and ML applications, our study can improve intelligent mental healthcare systems to detect early depressive symptoms and increase access to mental health services. Copyright  2022 Gil, Kim and Min.","The study provides evidence that the performance of ML algorithms can accurately predict college students who are at risk of depression in the context of parent-child relationships. The ML algorithm can help reduce bias and improve disease prediction accuracy using training datasets to train and test datasets to test (38, 39). The main strength of this study was the use of the family dataset to predict and identify family factors of depression in college students using ML techniques. With recent advancements and applications of ML, our study can help improve intelligent mental healthcare systems to detect early depressive symptoms and increase access to mental health services for college students.

Our data are high-dimensional, where variables are more than samples. This data feature causes two problems. First, the estimates are poorly defined when using linear regressions. Second, despite having analysis results, the interpretation is difficult owing to numerous variables. This dataset feature enabled us to investigate additional analysis techniques, such as SLR, RF, and SVM.

Sparse multivariable logistic regression is a well-known ML technique that enables the application of multivariable logistic regression to high-dimensional data (31). This technique simultaneously conducts estimation and variable selection to obtain interpretable results with estimated effect sizes. Conversely, SVM and RF have been unaffected by the high dimensionality of the data. Recently, these techniques have been widely used to analyze high-dimensional data, and numerous studies showed that these techniques outperform regression models (21, 40). Both techniques use all available variables to develop a prediction model; however, their results are not easily interpretable as those of regression models, which list important variables along with their estimated effect size (41). However, the RF model provides a list of important variables based on how each variable is used by the algorithm.

Our study demonstrated that SVM and RF outperformed sparse multivariable logistic regression in terms of prediction. Most of the metrics from these two methods were superior to those from the sparse multivariate logistic model. Particularly, RF demonstrated the best prediction performance. However, important variables can be identified from the results of sparse multivariable logistic regression, and its prediction performance is comparable with that of SVM and RF. This technique automatically selects significantly effective features using an algorithmic approach and estimates the effect size. Multiple model-selected variables are also included in the list of variables where an RF is suggested as an important feature. This finding suggested that considering the strategic use of multiple ML techniques from both prediction and inference standpoints is important.

In our study, mother's depression, respiratory diseases, and father's cancer, were identified as three family factors significant in predicting depression risk in college students. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that college students whose mothers had depression and respiratory diseases were more likely to experience depression. However, college students with fathers who have cancer have a lower risk of depression. These findings can be explained by the intergenerational effects of the parent's health status on depression in children. Children may feel stressed, powerless, and depressed in the presence of their mother's depression and fatigue leading to cough and breathlessness (42).

Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that maternal depression increases the risk of depression in early adulthood through poor parenting. Depressed mothers are more likely to express negative emotions toward their children and interact negatively with them, which interferes with the bond between the mothers and their children (43–45). Children with insecure attachments frequently struggle to identify or control their emotions, which may result in depression (46). To successfully reduce the emotional problems of college students and enhance positive mother-child relationships, family-based early interventions must be developed.

However, we found that college students whose fathers had cancer decreased the risk of depression. This is incongruent with a previous study, which found that children whose parents had cancer experience higher levels of depression than those with cancer-free parents (47). These findings contribute new knowledge to our understanding of the relationship between paternal cancer and depression in children. One justification is that fathers who realize more value in spending time with their children than at work after being diagnosed with cancer may increase communication with them, which helps children develop resilience and prevents depression (48, 49). Another justification is that children build resilience and reduce depression when they positively deal with a stressful situation, such as a father being diagnosed with cancer, by interpreting the situation positively and creating meaning (50–52). Future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms of paternal cancer in children with depression. Depression in college students can be measured against different mechanisms of maternal and paternal psychological and mental disorders.

We discovered that five individual factors were important in predicting depression in college students: family cohesion, fearful-avoidant attachment, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and self-perceived mental health. Family cohesion and fearful-avoidant attachment were found to be important factors that contribute to determining depression in college students using the RF approach. According to earlier studies, college students who reported a high level of family cohesion had a lower risk of depression than those with lower levels of cohesion. The former group experienced comfort, support, and togetherness within their families (53–55). However, students with fearful-avoidant attachment, high anxiety about rejection, and avoidance of intimacy experienced more depression than those with secure attachment (56). Because students with fearful-avoidant attachments perceive low family cohesion, repairing parent-child attachments reduces depression by building trust and safety with parents and using them as emotional supporters (55, 57, 58).

Logistic regression results demonstrated that neuroticism increased the risk of depression among college students, whereas conscientiousness decreased this risk. Neuroticism and conscientiousness, which are human personality traits, are associated with depression (59, 60). College students with higher neuroticism who tend to be emotionally unstable might often focus on their negative emotions, whereas those with higher conscientiousness, who tend to be goal-oriented, careful, and efficient, could efficiently direct their attention away from negative emotions (60, 61). Personality traits are difficult to change; however, training college students with neuroticism in adaptive emotional regulation strategies should help them prevent depression.

Our results implied that self-perceived mental health is a significant predictor of depression. The perception of mental health of an individual typically indicates their self-perceived mental health. These results were consistent with a previous study that demonstrated that poor self-perceived health is a risk factor for depression (62). College students who negatively perceive their mental health believe that they need professional treatment, but they refuse it because they believe that seeking help is a sign of weakness (63). However, if college students have good mental health, they do not feel the need to visit the hospital (64). Therefore, it is important to objectively evaluate or detect signs of depression in the mental health of college students.

Our study investigated the performance of the three ML algorithms and identified family and individual factors that could help predict depression in college students. Using AI technologies could reduce depression risk in college students and improve mental health. Our ML algorithms could use family data to screen college students for depression. Healthcare providers can use these ML algorithms to identify college students who may be at risk of depression and help them with early intervention.

This study has some limitations. First, although three factors, mother's depression, college students' cohesion, and college students' fearful-avoidant attachment, were identified as important factors in the RF approach, the direction of the effects of these factors is unknown. Second, it was difficult to interpret the causal relationship between the important factors and depression using the cross-sectional data. Finally, although the severity of chronic disease was included in the variables, it was evaluated from a subjective perspective. This should be considered in future studies.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated how to use family data to predict depression in college students using the ML models. We analyzed three ML models: sparse multivariable logistic regression, RF, and SVM to predict depression among college students and confirmed the significant contributing factors. The RF model demonstrated the best prediction performance among the three ML models. Additionally, sparse multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the important variables. The RF and sparse multivariable logistic regression results demonstrated that the health status of the parents, family factors of college students, personality traits, and self-perceived mental health were significant factors. Our study can help develop better ML models for mental health that can detect depression in college students.

Machine learning models for the prediction of postpartum depression: Application and comparison based on a cohort study,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious public health problem. Building a predictive model for PPD using data during pregnancy can facilitate earlier identification and intervention. Objective: The aims of this study are to compare the effects of four different machine learning models using data during pregnancy to predict PPD and explore which factors in the model are the most important for PPD prediction. Methods: Information on the pregnancy period from a cohort of 508 women, including demographics, social environmental factors, and mental health, was used as predictors in the models. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score within 42 days after delivery was used as the outcome indicator. Using two feature selection methods (expert consultation and random forest-based filter feature selection [FFS-RF]) and two algorithms (support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]), we developed four different machine learning PPD prediction models and compared their prediction effects. Results: There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the two feature selection methods in terms of model prediction performance, but 10 fewer factors were selected with the FFS-RF than with the expert consultation method. The model based on SVM and FFS-RF had the best prediction effects (sensitivity=0.69, area under the curve=0.78). In the feature importance ranking output by the RF algorithm, psychological elasticity, depression during the third trimester, and income level were the most important predictors. Conclusions: In contrast to the expert consultation method, FFS-RF was important in dimension reduction. When the sample size is small, the SVM algorithm is suitable for predicting PPD. In the prevention of PPD, more attention should be paid to the psychological resilience of mothers.  2020 Weina Zhang, Han Liu, Vincent Michael Bernard Silenzio, Peiyuan Qiu, Wenjie Gong.","We compared four PPD prediction models and provided a reference for the application of ML in PPD. Compared with the expert consultation method approach, the FFS-RF method identified fewer predictive factors. We found that the F-SVM model was the best model. The strongest predictive factor was the psychological resilience of pregnant women.

Between the expert consultation method and FFS-RF method, the latter selected far fewer predictive factors. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two methods in terms of their effects on model performance, indicating that the FFS-RS method could reduce dimensions and improve the efficiency of the algorithmic function without changing model predictive performance. The reduction in the number of predictive factors means that the burden of collecting information is reduced, making the model easier to implement and popularize, especially in busy obstetric clinics.

The SVM was chosen as the better algorithm, as it showed higher sensitivity than the RF algorithm (E-SVM=0.67, F-SVM=0.69, E-RF=0.48, F-RF=0.48). SVM had a clear advantage over RF in processing our research data, and the smaller sample size may be the main reason for this finding. Previous research on depression suggested that sample size is a key factor affecting the performance of ML models. When the sample size is small, SVM can avoid overfitting while providing efficient computing time and produces better prediction results in depression [29,30]. Our results also support this view. Therefore, we believe that when the data set is small, SVM is more practical than RF in prediction research for PPD. Several previous studies used the SVM algorithm to make PPD predictions. Jiménez [13] collected data on postpartum women from seven Spanish hospitals and used the EPDS score as the outcome indicator to train a PPD prediction model based on SVM. Sriraam [15] used social media as a data source and, based on the mental health data of 173 mothers, a SVM-based PPD prediction model was established. De Choudhury [31] developed a SVM model to identify high-risk emotions and behaviors predictive of PPD using the content of Twitter posts. As these studies either target different populations or use different methods to detect the occurrence of PPD, the model prediction effects cannot be easily compared. However, the results of the optimal F-SVM model in our study are within range (sensitivity=0.69, ROC-AUC=0.78) and consistent with the findings of previous studies (sensitivity=0.56-0.78, ROC-AUC=0.63-0.81) [13,15,31]. Due to the negative effects of PPD on mothers and infants [32,33], such as the negative effects on the physical and mental health of mothers, the closeness of the mother-infant bond, and infant development, it is important to have a model with high sensitivity while maintaining a high ROC-AUC value. The selection of indicators in evaluating depression prediction models varies across studies. For example, Sriraam [15] and De Choudhury [31] emphasized the accuracy of the model's prediction of PPD. Jiménez [13] emphasized model sensitivity and specificity. The balance between them is the geometric mean. The ROC-AUC is also widely used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of a model [14,15]. Our evaluation criteria provide a reference for prediction research for screening purposes, but the approach may be different in research studies.

We found that the top 3 most important predictors in the models were psychological resilience, depression during the third trimester, and monthly income level. First, psychological resilience is the most important factor in the prediction of PPD, which can be attributed to the protective effect of psychological elasticity. Pregnancy and childbirth are a challenging time for women emotionally and physiologically, and the mother's body and mind are under greater stress [15]. Previous research has shown that psychological resilience as an important regulatory process can enable people to recover from and adapt to stress and life events, reducing the occurrence of adverse outcomes [34-36]. Our results also support the findings of Lu [37], who found that the level of psychological elasticity was negatively correlated with the occurrence of PPD. Second, the results regarding depression in the third trimester are consistent with most previous studies. Depression in the third trimester is associated with PPD [9,38,39]. A review by Robertson [5] mentioned that “depression and anxiety during pregnancy are the strongest predictors of PPD”. Mora's [40] research suggests that depression in the third trimester may continue to develop into the postpartum period. Third, the monthly income levels remain important factors affecting PPD, which supports Rhonda's [41] findings that mothers with low income levels faced obstacles in using mental health resources and were more likely to be frustrated. Epidemiological studies of PPD worldwide have also found that the incidence in developing countries is higher than that in developed countries [42].

The identification of these predictors also reveals the different aspects of PPD risk factors. A pregnant woman's psychological elasticity may reflect her personality traits. Depression in the third trimester may be a special symptom accompanying pregnancy. The income of a pregnant woman and her partner reflects the stability and coping resources available to them. It indicates that PPD risk should be assessed based on a combination of individual long-term, short-term, and environmental characteristics.

This study has several limitations. First, there was potential selection bias. Women who were not lost to follow-up might have had a greater awareness of mental health services. Second, the 50% loss to follow-up and small sample size may have negatively affected the applicability of the PPD model, indicating that more extensive validation is required. Third, a larger number of potential predictive factors would have been useful. Further studies should develop different PPD models using other ML algorithms and data from different sources as well as incorporating additional cultural factors to expand the application of the PPD models."
Machine learning prediction models for postpartum depression: A multicenter study in Japan,"Aim: Postpartum depression (PPD) and perinatal mental health care are of growing importance worldwide. Here we aimed to develop and validate machine learning models for the prediction of PPD, and to evaluate the usefulness of the recently adopted 2-week postpartum checkup in some parts of Japan for the identification of women at high risk of PPD. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted using the clinical data of 10 013 women who delivered at ≥35 weeks of gestation at 12 maternity care hospitals in Japan. PPD was defined as an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of ≥9 points at 4 weeks postpartum. We developed prediction models using conventional logistic regression and four machine learning algorithms based on the information that can be routinely collected in daily clinical practice. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: In the machine learning models developed using clinical data before discharge, the AUROCs were similar to those in the conventional logistic regression models (AUROC, 0.569–0.630 vs. 0.626). The incorporation of additional 2-week postpartum checkup data into the model significantly improved the predictive performance for PPD compared to that without in the Ridge regression and Elastic net (AUROC, 0.702 vs. 0.630 [p < 0.01] and 0.701 vs. 0.628 [p < 0.01], respectively). Conclusions: Our machine learning models did not achieve better predictive performance for PPD than conventional logistic regression models. However, we demonstrated the usefulness of the 2-week postpartum checkup for the identification of women at high risk of PPD.  2022 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.","In this study, we aimed to develop and validate machine learning prediction models for PPD using only basic information that can be routinely collected in daily clinical practice without additional psychological assessment, and to determine whether a 2-week postpartum checkup contributes to the identification of women at high risk of PPD. The main finding of this study was that our machine learning models could not achieve better predictive performance for PPD compared in conventional logistic regression models and previously published machine learning models (AUROC, 0.71–0.94).18-23 However, data on self-administered questionnaires at the 2-week postpartum checkup contributed in the significant improvement of model performance, indicating that a 2-week postpartum checkup may be useful to identify women with PPD and anxiety symptoms. This is an important study demonstrating the usefulness of the 2-week postpartum checkup in Japan from the viewpoint of PPD detection, consistent with a previous study.12

Contrary to our expectations, our prediction models showed significantly lower predictive accuracy than previous models that used electronic health records or clinical data with additional psychological assessment (AUROC, 0.71–0.94).18-23 Although model performance was superior to those of individual risk factors (parity: AUROC 0.588 [0.566–0.611], history of mental disorders: 0.527 [0.503–0.550], maternal age: 0.524 [0.501–0.547], and smoking status: 0.532 [0.508–0.556] in our dataset), the predictive performance was far from satisfactory for PPD prediction. Possible explanations for this include the following: (1) This study mainly targeted low-risk women at level 1 maternity care facilities; thus, the prevalence of previous mental disorders, which is one of the most important contributing factors for PPD, was considerably lower than that reported in previous studies (1.7% vs. 10.8%–30.4%, respectively).18, 22, 23 Similarly, Andersson et al. demonstrated that the predictive performance of models targeting women with no previous depression episode before and during pregnancy was significantly lower than that targeting all women (AUC: 0.73 vs. 0.81, respectively).23 (2) The variables incorporated in our models may be insufficient, both in terms of quality and quantity, to accurately predict PPD. Previous models tended to use relatively more variables in the model (25–126 variables). In addition, previous models utilized electronic health record data closely related to PPD (e.g., drug prescriptions, including antidepressants, and diagnoses, such as depression or anxiety during pregnancy), and depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy using additional psychological assessment tools (e.g., Brief Resilience Scale, EPDS score during pregnancy, State–Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7).18-20, 23 Clinical data that are directly related to PPD can provide considerably greater predictive performance as a matter of course. However, our models incorporated basic clinical data without psychometric measures because our primary objective was to develop models with versatility using only basic information that can be routinely collected in daily clinical practice. (3) The low event rate (6.4% of all analyzed women had high EPDS scores), which is described as an imbalanced dataset, may have led to a significantly poor predictive performance in machine learning models.23 Although we applied the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to deal with the data imbalance issue, the predictive performance did not significantly improve (data not shown). Collectively, our study and previous studies indicate that routinely collected basic characteristics, except for the three major contributing factors (history of mental disorders, smoking during pregnancy, and primipara), did not significantly contribute to the prediction of PPD in our multifactorial prediction models; therefore, additional psychological assessments evaluating depression and anxiety symptoms are essential for better prediction of PPD.

Of the three variables collected using a self-report questionnaire at the 2-week postpartum checkup, poor mental health condition stood out as an important variable for model performance in Model 3. In addition, we found that a simple self-report questionnaire regarding mental health, sleep quality, and breastfeeding experience significantly improved the predictive performance, indicating the usefulness of a 2-week postpartum checkup from the perspective of identifying women at high risk for PPD. As recommended by the ACOG, initial assessment before 3_weeks postpartum may enable accurate evaluation of postpartum mental status, allowing timely identification and intervention.13, 34 Furthermore, even simple questionnaires with dichotomous questions (good/bad) instead of complicated questionnaires may have sufficient predictive power to identify women at high risk of PPD.

We developed three types of models to demonstrate how data acquired at different timings affect predictive performance. Although some of the variables regarding pregnancy-related or delivery-related characteristics (e.g., placenta previa/low-lying placenta and maternal transfer to higher-level facilities) were ranked in the top three important variables and were recognized as risk factors for PPD,35-37 these variables did not significantly improve predictive performance in almost all machine learning algorithms in Model 2 compared to those in Model 1. This indicates that variables associated with pregnancy-related and delivery-related characteristics are less important than maternal baseline and postpartum characteristics, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study.38

This study had several strengths. First, the sample size was large, which enabled the accurate development and validation of prediction models. In addition, both internal and external validation were performed. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop machine learning prediction models for PPD in Japan. Third, we addressed the usefulness of the 2-week postpartum checkup in identifying high-risk women with depression and anxiety symptoms. Finally, we analyzed and developed three types of models to demonstrate how data acquired at different timings affect model performance.

This study has several limitations. First, the outcome of this study was based on the EPDS score at postpartum 4_weeks and not PPD diagnosis by structured clinical interviews. However, EPDS has been used as a surrogate for PPD in many studies, including machine learning models for PPD.19, 20, 23 Second, we could not evaluate how the 0.07 AUROC value improvement in Model 3 can contribute in the prediction of PPD in clinical practice. In addition, the interpretation of the model performance is difficult because the classifier performance indices, such as sensitivity and specificity, vary greatly depending on the cutoff points used. Third, there was no clear literature-based rationale for asking dichotomous questions (good/bad) regarding sleep, mental, and breastfeeding conditions at 2_weeks postpartum. Fourth, we cannot deny the possibility of systematic biases because we divided the clinical data into derivation and validation datasets according to the designated data of delivery. However, this problem cannot be solved unless data are prospectively collected. Finally, we cannot completely exclude the risk of bias attributed to multicollinearity in the analysis of the significance of explanatory variables. Further research is needed regarding the validity of the contribution of explanatory variables and their independence.

In conclusion, machine learning models using basic clinical data without psychometric measures could not achieve better predictive performance for PPD compared to conventional logistic regression models or previously published machine learning models. Our results indicate that an additional psychological assessment evaluating depression and anxiety symptoms is essential for a better prediction of PPD. However, we provide evidence regarding the usefulness of the 2-week postpartum checkup recently adopted in Japan from the viewpoint of identifying women at high risk of PPD."
Machine Learning Prediction of Treatment Outcome in Late-Life Depression,"Background: Recent evidence suggests that integration of multi-modal data improves performance in machine learning prediction of depression treatment outcomes. Here, we compared the predictive performance of three machine learning classifiers using differing combinations of sociodemographic characteristics, baseline clinical self-reports, cognitive tests, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to predict treatment outcomes in late-life depression (LLD). Methods: Data were combined from two clinical trials conducted with depressed adults aged 60 and older, including response to escitalopram (N = 32, NCT01902004) and Tai Chi (N = 35, NCT02460666). Remission was defined as a score of 6 or less on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) at the end of 24 weeks of treatment. Features subsets were constructed from baseline sociodemographic and clinical features, gray matter volumes (GMVs), or both. Three classification algorithms were compared: (1) Support Vector Machine-Radial Bias Function (SVMRBF), (2) Random Forest (RF), and (3) Logistic Regression (LR). A repeated 5-fold cross-validation approach with a wrapper-based feature selection method was used for model fitting. Model performance metrics included Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Cross-validated performance significance was tested by permutation analysis. Classifiers were compared by Cochran's Q and post-hoc pairwise comparisons using McNemar's Chi-Square test with Bonferroni correction. Results: For the RF and SVMRBF algorithms, the combined feature set outperformed the clinical and GMV feature sets with a final cross-validated AUC of 0.83 ± 0.11 and 0.80 ± 0.11, respectively. Both classifiers passed permutation analysis. The LR algorithm performed best using GMV features alone (AUC 0.79 ± 0.14) but failed to pass permutation analysis using any feature set. Performance of the three classifiers differed significantly for all three features sets. Important predictive features of treatment response included anterior and posterior cingulate volumes, depression characteristics, and self-reported health-related quality scores. Conclusion: This preliminary exploration into the use of ML and multi-modal data to identify predictors of general treatment response in LLD indicates that integration of clinical and structural MRI features significantly increases predictive capability. Identified features are among those previously implicated in geriatric depression, encouraging future work in this arena.  Copyright  2021 Grzenda, Speier, Siddarth, Pant, Krause-Sorio, Narr and Lavretsky.","LLD, like other mood disorders, involves a complicated, multi-directional interplay between biology, psychological, environmental, and social mediators. Considerable heterogeneity exists in clinical phenotypes among patients with LLD, reflective of differing psychobiological pathways to illness. Here, we have demonstrated prediction of treatment response in LLD is improved using a combination of feature types. Our results mirror that of Patel et al. (17), where the authors integrated clinical, cognitive, and MRI data toward improved prediction of diagnosis and treatment response to a 12-week open trial of several different antidepressants in LLD.

The features identified as influencing classifier prediction in the current study corroborate several prior findings in the literature. Age of depression onset and cardiovascular health are among the most notable. LLD encompasses both individuals with early-onset depression (EOD), who develop depressive symptoms before the age of 25 and experience recurrent episodes across lifetime, and individuals with first presentation after age 50–65, or late-onset depression (LOD). The LOD phenotype displays less heritability and a stronger association with underlying cerebrovascular disease with a clinical profile of fronto-subcortical dysfunction, apathy, higher likelihood of progression to dementia, and increased antidepressant resistance (32–34).

Self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures (SF36—energy, SF36—emotional well-being) as well as baseline depression severity and chronicity also emerged as informative to prediction, consistent with prior investigations (35–38). Chronic physical disability associates to poor prognosis (39–41). Among the GMVs identified, dysfunction and differences in the anterior cingulate in LLD is well-established (42–44). Entorhinal volume also associates to multiple aspects of LLD, including somatic symptoms and cognitive impairment/conversion to dementia (45–47). Volume of the entorhinal cortex is inversely associated with the number of years since the first episode of depression and associates with treatment-resistant depression in females (6, 45).

The type of response predicted in the current study is general rather than treatment-specific. While the character of the two clinical trial cohorts did not differ substantially in demographics or illness features, the treatment modalities and conditions varied with one group initiating a new SSRI while the other continued their existing antidepressant or therapy and received a new add-on health intervention. Differential treatment response prediction is the goal of the precision medicine approach. However, just as there are converging and diverging pathways to depression, converging and diverging pathways in treatment response (and resistance) are anticipated. Certain data types may offer differing levels of discriminatory predictive power. For example, in a recent study in a sample of 81,630 adults, treatment-specific predictive models from electronic health record data did not perform better than general treatment response models (48). A classifier capable of predicting treatment response to a focused range of options (e.g., SSRIs) could arguably hold higher clinical utility in practice than one that predicts response to a single agent (49, 50).

The current work has several strengths, including the rigor of the analysis. Machine learning algorithms possess known variability in their tolerance for number of features, multi-collinearity, and noise. The RF classifier, for example, performed well-across all feature sets and demonstrated the least degradation in performance (generalization error) on the testing data. The primary limitations of the study are the small sample size and lack of a dataset with similar features for external validation. Cross-validation is only an estimate of performance on unseen data. The generalizability of a model cannot be fully determined without validation in an external dataset (51). Additionally, “small” data is prone to overfitting, even with robust feature selection and cross-validation. For the current work, a static number of features were employed in each feature set to permit comparison across classifiers. In moving from exploratory analysis to development of an optimized model, features could be even more aggressively reduced, hyperparameters tuned (e.g., limiting the maximum depth of the branching of the RF classifier, the number of support vectors for SVMRBF), and models combined (ensemble modeling) to further reduce overfitting."
Machine learning techniques for predicting depression and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional regional study,"Background: Maternal depression and anxiety are significant public health concerns that play an important role in the health and well-being of mothers and children. The COVID-19 pandemic, the consequential lockdowns and related safety restrictions worldwide negatively affected the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: This regional study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for the prediction of maternal depression and anxiety. The study used a dataset collected from five Arab countries during the COVID-19 pandemic between July to December 2020. The population sample included 3569 women (1939 pregnant and 1630 postpartum) from five countries (Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain). The performance of seven machine learning algorithms was assessed for the prediction of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: The Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF) models outperformed other studied ML algorithms with accuracy values of 83.3% and 83.2% for depression, respectively, and values of 82.9% and 81.3% for anxiety, respectively. The Mathew's Correlation Coefficient was evaluated for the ML models; the Naïve Bayes (NB) and GB models presented the highest performance measures (0.63 and 0.59) for depression and (0.74 and 0.73) for anxiety, respectively. The features' importance ranking was evaluated, the results showed that stress during pregnancy, family support, financial issues, income, and social support were the most significant values in predicting anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Overall, the study evidenced the power of ML models in predicting maternal depression and anxiety and proved to be an efficient tool for identifying and predicting the associated risk factors that influence maternal mental health. The deployment of machine learning models for screening and early detection of depression and anxiety among pregnant and postpartum women might facilitate the development of health prevention and intervention programs that will enhance maternal and child health in low- and middle-income countries.  2022 Qasrawi R et al.","In this study, we used machine learning techniques for the prediction of depression and anxiety among pregnant and postpartum women from five Middle Eastern countries (Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia) during the COVID-19 lockdown. We found that 20.3% of women had moderate to severe maternal depression while 30.1% of them had moderate to severe anxiety, the highest rates being among Palestinian and Jordanian women. The findings of this study are consistent with other studies that indicated high levels of anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women during COVID-19 lockdown3. Women reported a significant concern and were found at high risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder, which requires direct intervention from health care providers for caring of pregnant and postpartum women mental health during COVID-19 pandemic.

The performance of different ML models in predicting maternal depression and anxiety was evaluated through measuring accuracy, specificity, precision, recall, F-measure, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The accuracy performance of the studied models was similar and did not indicate a significant difference across models. GB and RF reported the best accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 measures for depression prediction. The MCC has been measured for the selected models as an alternative performance measure which is not affected by an unbalanced dataset. The MCC measure showed acceptable scores for both depression and anxiety symptoms. The NB had the highest MCC values followed by GB and RF. Thus, the results in this study are consistent with other studies that assessed the performance of ML classifiers in predicting depression among pregnant and postpartum women, where the RF model showed the highest accuracy and AUC values16,24.

The ML prediction models of postpartum depression developed by Shin et al., (2020) achieved an AUC of 0.79. On the other hand29, utilized a multilayer perceptron approach using several risk factors for depression prediction among Spanish pregnant and postpartum women. The model accomplished an AUC value of 0.82, sensitivity value of 0.84, and specificity of 0.81. Furthermore, in a study, Logistic Regression (LR) classifier was used for depression prediction and achieved an accuracy value of 83.3%30 while employing multiple ML algorithms including KNN, LR, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and B improved the overall accuracy values to 90%28,29. Additionally, our study was consistent with 24 study in which the ML classifiers were used in predicting postpartum depression and found that depression before pregnancy, stress during pregnancy, and smoking were the most significant risk factors for depression. On the contrary of our findings31, reported that women’s age, marital status, and education were the most significant factors relating to postpartum depression.

Furthermore, our study reported a higher AUC performance measure than other similar ML prediction studies, whose AUC measures were 80%32, 79%5, and 78%33. The results in our study showed an accuracy of 83.3%, which is comparable to the 84% accuracy rate reported in other studies26,30. Nevertheless, the study sample used in this research was collected from diverse population groups across countries, thus diverging background and environmental factors were expected to affect the homogeneity of the dataset.

Significant risk factors for pregnant and postpartum depression and anxiety were found, including country of residence, family income, smoking, COVID-19 diagnosis, number of hours of sleep, stress during the COVID-19 lockdown, family support, social support, financial situation, psychological problems, and work stress. Additionally, risk factors particularly significant for anxiety included education level, locality, and work status. We found the rates of anxiety symptoms to be higher than those of depression among pregnant and postpartum women during the pandemic lockdown. The results showed that Jordanian, Palestinian and Lebanese women had higher anxiety and depression than Saudi and Bahraini women. The increased risk for depression and anxiety among women could be explained by low family income, financial problems, and poor healthcare systems available in these countries34. The study also reported significant differences in anxiety because of locality and education levels. Women with lower education levels reported higher anxiety; similarly, women living in urban areas presented higher anxiety levels. These findings could be explained by the stricter lockdown in cities and the lack of knowledge about the disease among women with lower education levels.

The machine learning models returned the five highest ranking features affecting women’s depression symptoms: stress during pregnancy, psychological problems, family support, country of residence, and number of hours of sleep-in descending order. The highest-ranking features for anxiety were stress during pregnancy, financial problems, family problems, social problems, and COVID-19 diagnosis. Our findings are consistent with similar studies indicating that stress during pregnancy negatively affects women's mental health and might influence incidence of postpartum depression9,14,32. Furthermore, the results were consistent with other studies indicating that family income, and social and psychological problems had significant impact on maternal mental health3,6,8.

The study provides an interesting finding that the accuracy performance measures is relatively high and remains stable between the selected ML models, especially for AUC, accuracy, and sensitivity even at reduced number of variables. This finding is consistent with other studies17,31,34–36 that indicated the high correlation between anxiety and depression symptoms and other socio-demographic risk factors. Thus, stress, family support, financial situation, psychological problems, and country of residence were among the most important variables associated with depression and anxiety during the pandemic lockdown. This is important to consider when developing intervention strategies and programs. The stability in performance measures reflects that the self-reported survey methods can be used as a good assessment tool for anxiety and depression. Moreover, pregnant women had more anxiety symptoms than depression during lockdown, which might affect maternal and child health.

Our findings suggest that deploying machine learning techniques for the screening of pregnant and postpartum women will help in identifying those at highest risk of anxiety and depression through clustering and classification, which will in turn aid in the development of effective preventive interventions. Thus, this research not only addresses the integration of innovative technology for the prediction and diagnosis of depression and anxiety among pregnant and postpartum women in low- and middle-income countries, but given the international dataset used, it assesses the prediction power of several ML algorithms across diverging population groups with distinct risk factors. Additionally, the study included variables specific to the COVID-19 lockdown period, which differentiates it from similar studies.

Nevertheless, some limitations are found in this study, including the extent of the study sample. Having a smaller dataset limits the power of predictions to train a robust range of algorithms, as well as limits the number of clusters and classifications produced by the ML predictive models. In addition, the study used the online self-reported assessment, which was not fully completed by all study participants. Nonetheless, the incomplete and missing data were excluded from out dataset. Finally, a more comprehensive study with a larger and more representative dataset including clinical data is recommended for future research among low- and middle-income countries."
"Machine learning using multimodal clinical, electroencephalographic, and magnetic resonance imaging data can predict incident depression in adults with epilepsy: A pilot study","Objective: This study was undertaken to develop a multimodal machine learning (ML) approach for predicting incident depression in adults with epilepsy. Methods: We randomly selected 200 patients from the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program registry and linked their registry-based clinical data to their first-available clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. We excluded patients with a clinical or Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E)-based diagnosis of major depression at baseline. The NDDI-E was used to detect incident depression over a median of 2.4 years of follow-up (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.5–3.3 years). A ReliefF algorithm was applied to clinical as well as quantitative EEG and MRI parameters for feature selection. Six ML algorithms were trained and tested using stratified threefold cross-validation. Multiple metrics were used to assess model performances. Results: Of 200 patients, 150 had EEG and MRI data of sufficient quality for ML, of whom 59 were excluded due to prevalent depression. Therefore, 91 patients (41 women) were included, with a median age of 29 (IQR = 22–44) years. A total of 42 features were selected by ReliefF, none of which was a quantitative MRI or EEG variable. All models had a sensitivity > 80%, and five of six had an F1 score ≥.72. A multilayer perceptron model had the highest F1 score (median =.74, IQR =.71–.78) and sensitivity (84.3%). Median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and normalized Matthews correlation coefficient were.70 (IQR =.64–.78) and.57 (IQR =.50–.65), respectively. Significance: Multimodal ML using baseline features can predict incident depression in this population. Our pilot models demonstrated high accuracy for depression prediction. However, overall performance and calibration can be improved. This model has promise for identifying those at risk for incident depression during follow-up, although efforts to refine it in larger populations along with external validation are required.  2023 International League Against Epilepsy.","Our pilot study showed that it is feasible to link demographic, clinical, and PROM data to quantitative EEG and MRI data for predictive modeling to create multisource models in epilepsy. Likewise, our study shows that ML algorithms using available features from the first clinic visit were able to predict future incident depression in non-surgically treated patients with clinically relevant accuracy. This is likely in part because clinically informed models tend to outperform those solely dependent on data-driven methods.33 These models demonstrate moderate to high discriminative capacity, which is ideal for a screening test. Here, the goal is to identify patients at high risk for depression, thus permitting targeted follow-up and management through confirmatory testing and treatment.

The discriminative capacity is not surprising, because the predictors identified by the ReliefF algorithm (Table S3) are clinically intuitive and consistent with prior reports. For instance, anxiety34, 35 and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder36 are well-known risk factors for incident depression. Also, alcohol use disorders have been associated with an increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms.37 Some of the seizure- and ASM-related predictors identified, such as the need for polytherapy, are also reportedly associated with emergent depression in people with epilepsy.35

Interestingly, the quantitative MRI and EEG features were not selected by the ReliefF algorithm, a phenomenon that could be explained in two ways. First, clinical factors including psychosocial and seizure- and epilepsy-related factors, as well as medical comorbidities, are highly associated with depression,35 and their inclusion may supersede other features with comparatively less robust predictive capacity. QoL and health state valuation are highly correlated with the severity of prevalent depression, typically more so than seizure frequency,38 and thus may also exert strong predictive power for incident depression. Additionally, clinical features are highly complex, and presuming they ultimately arise from underlying neuroanatomical and neurophysiological states, may include manifold latent variables including components of the underlying quantitative EEG and MRI data. If so, this could render the latter less informative due to variance inflation and multicollinearity. Second, the quantitative EEG and MRI features we selected a priori for this study may fail to exert predictive capacity either because they represent a single ""snapshot"" in time, the dynamics of which could have changed just prior to developing depression, or these specific features, although useful for predicting seizure freedom, may not exist on a causal pathway for depression in epilepsy. Evidence from our study may support the latter, as four different clinically reported EEG abnormalities (focal and generalized interictal epileptiform discharges as well as focal and generalized slowing) were selected as relevant predictors in our models. Exploration of other quantitative neurophysiological and anatomical features, as well as applying raw data to larger samples in deep learning approaches, could therefore improve model performance, even though clinical and psychosocial factors could be the primary drivers of depression in epilepsy.

We felt inclusion of EEG and MRI biomarkers was integral to investigate whether they are any more predictive of depression beyond the clinical variables. Although no quantitative EEG or MRI biomarker was selected by the final model, this work still has important clinical implications in that quantitative macro- and microstructural MRI biomarker data, as well as quantitative EEG data, may not be useful to acquire for this specific task. However, other biomarkers and complementary imaging modalities, such as functional MRI, were not investigated and may still provide predictive information, which is beyond the scope of this work. However, this study adds value by informing these future studies.

Our study benefits from a well-defined population of people with epilepsy and granular information on epilepsy type, seizure types and frequency, treatment modalities, and comorbidities. We were able to use detailed demographic, clinical, and PROM data to accurately detect new onset depression, and well as comprehensively and consistently follow patients for up to 6.4_years (IQR_=_1.5–3.3_years). The included population is representative of patients attending tertiary care epilepsy clinics in developed Western nations. We used well-described ML models only after automatic feature selection to reduce risks of overfitting. We also report multiple metrics—including F1 score, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and normalized MCC—to permit readers the ability to fully evaluate each model.39

This study has some limitations that should be discussed. First, our population included only 91 patients, limited due to the need for convenience sampling related to restricted resources, the need to exclude people with prevalent depression (which is common in epilepsy due to their bidirectional relationship2, 40), and data quality issues in real-world practice.41, 42 Increasing the sample size through acquisition of additional resources will likely result in greater precision and facilitate additional advanced analytic techniques such as deep learning. Deep learning will have the benefit of processing raw MRI and EEG signal data without the need for computing a priori features. Ultimately, exploration of other quantitative features, use of deep learning, and applying survival-based ML models could improve model performance. Imbalanced patient sample is another limitation of our analyses. In this context, rare outcomes are harder to predict, because there are fewer examples in the dataset. This imbalance is probably intrinsic and therefore resulted from naturally occurring frequencies,40 as our sample was randomly selected from the CEP registry. Hence, it was important to report measures other than simple accuracy, such as the MCC,39 to provide a transparent picture of model performance. We also relied on the NDDI-E to determine depression, which while having a high sensitivity (.81) and specificity (.90) for major depression, has a more modest positive predictive value (.62).14 Although positive predictive value is dependent on prevalence, and therefore not immutable between populations, we cannot rule out that a plethora of false positive cases identified by the NDDI-E may have led to reduced specificity in our model.

ML algorithms using data derived from the first clinic visit are promising tools to predict incident depression in non-surgically treated patients with epilepsy. Such data can form the nidus of pipelines linking MRI and EEG studies for the purposes of prediction modeling. After application to feature and dimensionality reduction algorithms, such data can be used in ML classifiers to predict outcomes with increasing accuracy, thus galvanizing efforts to advance precision epilepsy. Specifically, our pilot models demonstrated a high accuracy for incident depression prediction, which is promising for potential use of the pipeline for other prediction and classification tasks in patients with epilepsy. These models are ideally situated as screening tools where high discriminatory capacity is desired. Despite this, future efforts are needed to refine and externally validate these algorithms before they are ready for clinical practice. Other quantitative MRI and EEG features, as well as the application of deep learning to larger samples, could add value to fully exploit these modalities for depression prediction in people with epilepsy. Finally, using the aforementioned approaches, we can also identify features strongly predictive of depression, thus permitting precision studies targeting early intervention in individual patients to improve outcomes. Based on these data, such endeavors are feasible and should be pursued with immediate effect.

Machine Learning-Based Prediction Models for Depression Symptoms Among Chinese Healthcare Workers During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak in 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)-related depression symptoms of healthcare workers have received worldwide recognition. Although many studies identified risk exposures associated with depression symptoms among healthcare workers, few have focused on a predictive model using machine learning methods. As a society, governments, and organizations are concerned about the need for immediate interventions and alert systems for healthcare workers who are mentally at-risk. This study aims to develop and validate machine learning-based models for predicting depression symptoms using survey data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Method: Surveys were conducted of 2,574 healthcare workers in hospitals designated to care for COVID-19 patients between 20 January and 11 February 2020. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-9 was used to measure the depression symptoms and quantify the severity, a score of ≥5 on the PHQ-9 represented depression symptoms positive, respectively. Four machine learning approaches were trained (75% of data) and tested (25% of data). Cross-validation with 100 repetitions was applied to the training dataset for hyperparameter tuning. Finally, all models were compared to evaluate their predictive performances and screening utility: decision tree, logistics regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest, and gradient-boosting tree. Results: Important risk predictors identified and ranked by the machine learning models were highly consistent: self-perceived health status factors always occupied the top five most important predictors, followed by worried about infection, working on the frontline, a very high level of uncertainty, having received any form of psychological support material and having COVID-19-like symptoms. The area under the curve [95% CI] of machine learning models were as follows: LASSO model, 0.824 [0.792–0.856]; random forest, 0.828 [0.797–0.859]; gradient-boosting tree, 0.829 [0.798–0.861]; and decision tree, 0.785 [0.752–0.819]. The calibration plot indicated that the LASSO model, random forest, and gradient-boosting tree fit the data well. Decision curve analysis showed that all models obtained net benefits for predicting depression symptoms. Conclusions: This study shows that machine learning prediction models are suitable for making predictions about mentally at-risk healthcare workers predictions in a public health emergency setting. The application of multidimensional machine learning models could support hospitals' and healthcare workers' decision-making on possible psychological interventions and proper mental health management. Copyright  2022 Zhou, Luo, Yang and Liu.","This study successfully applied machine learning techniques to predict depression symptoms with reasonable accuracy and net benefit. In addition to the identified risk exposures that were already confirmed in previous studies [e.g., working on the frontline (11), worry about infection (12), and location of residence (11)], several hidden predictors associated with the mental health outcomes were uncovered which could be meaningful in constructing interventions. The decision curve analysis further suggested utility in mental screening implications.

As for the practice of “psychological first aid,” machine learning models identified several potential predictors that implied some possible mental interventions for healthcare workers. Information overload refers to the amount of news received that exceeds the limit of an individual's information processing capacity (44) and has been frequently studied in its association with the mental wellbeing of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic (45–47). This study supported the existence of such an association between information overload and depression among healthcare workers and recognized several possible information overload thresholds. The LASSO model identified that an individual who spends over 5 h seeking COVID-19 information has higher odds of developing depression symptoms compared to those spending 1–2 h in obtaining COVID-19 information. Tree-based variable selection methods also identified spending 1–2 h obtaining COVID-19 information and spending over 5 h are paired predictors for depression symptoms. Moreover, all methods identified that receiving any form of psychological support material (both paper-based and media-based) can serve as important self-help therapy against depression. As several studies urged self-help strategies and social/mental health supports for healthcare workers during the pandemic (48–50), offering psychological support material can potentially be one feasible self-help solution. There are many advantages to offering psychological support material as a self-help intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the high contagion of the virus and strict quarantine policy, traditional face-to-face psychotherapy is difficult to implement. Offering self-help psychological support material is an immediate intervention with minimum psychological therapist contact and increases the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Plus, self-help interventions appeared to be the preferred option against depression over antidepressant medications (51). For healthcare workers who are worried about medication side effects or unwilling to show signs of mental hardship during employment, providing mental health/wellness pamphlets to all healthcare workers would be an appropriate resource for everyone.

Strengths and Implications
This study has some major strengths compared with other COVID-related mental health studies. As far as we know, this is the first study to apply machine learning prediction models focusing on depression symptoms in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. A sample size of 2,574 with 1,187 events allows for multifold cross-validation to prevent model overfitting and uses a separate test dataset to evaluate predictive performance.

Tree-based machine learning methods have advantages of modeling variable to variable interactions (52, 53), complex data (54), and nonparametric data (55). For example, complex categorical variables (in this study: self-perceived health factors, media factors, and psychological services factors) were usually ignored or excluded from previous COVID-19 mental health survey studies (11–13). This is because conventional statistical approaches (such as univariate or multivariate logistic regression) that were commonly adopted either are impossible to model hundreds of interactions among variables or have to follow strict data distribution assumptions. Hence, tree-based machine learning models not only provide more accurate predictions but also provide a different angle by looking at survey data using a data-driven approach instead of a traditional hypothesis-driven approach.

As for the screening implication, the researchers believe this machine learning-based prediction model would play a crucial role as an efficient early screening tool and report information to hospitals about healthcare workers' mental status. Especially when background knowledge of depression caused by the outbreak is lacking, machine learning models could make predictions by using easily acquired information such as demographic data, work-related factors, outbreak factors, or self-perceived factors. They may enable hospitals to quickly collect depression statistics and accurately identify individual at-risk workers for targeted interventions and proper management. The other advantage is that giving actual probabilities of depression symptoms is more informative to healthcare workers than Yes/No answers. Healthcare workers can self-evaluate their current mental status through the depression probabilities and then decide whether they need professional mental health support. These machine learning techniques can be easily implemented in software such as the WeChat mini program and Weibo. Further to enhance the use, allowing some programs to extract healthcare workers' basic demographic data would be necessary. Although there are several well-established depression screening tools (24, 56, 57), none of them is designed for use during a pandemic situation. Taking a step back, even if machine learning models do not show superior performance over conventional screening tools, combined use with conventional tools could still be very beneficial because they may provide more diagnostic information specifically in a public health emergency setting.

Limitations
This study has several major limitations which could point the direction for future research. First, large sample size and ethnic diversity of participants are always required for cross-site validating of model performance. It is often difficult to obtain a large sample at one geographic location, and even more difficult to contain participants from ethnic minorities or other races globally. In our survey, 1,102 (42.81%) healthcare workers were from Wuhan city with predominantly Han Chinese. To address this problem, integrating data from international sites would be essential for future work to conduct cross-site model validations. Machine learning models can be trained at one or several independent sites in one country and tested at different sites abroad. The advantage of such cross-site validation is it can correct overfitting problems arising at a single geographic location. Cross-site validation technique had been successfully applied to the classification of mental disorders such as schizophrenia classification using MRI data and showed promising performance. Rozycki et al. (58) used data from 941 participants from 5 sites (location: China, United States, and Germany) to build a linear support vector machine that discovered important neuroanatomical biomarkers of patients with schizophrenia and find robust generalizability of these biomarkers across different sites. Zeng et al. (59) cross-validated deep learning models from 7 sites located in both China and the United States; and found reliable connectome patterns of schizophrenia across independent sites. The above studies did both pooling classification and leave-site-out validation and obtained high classification accuracy (AUC around 0.8). These cross-site validation methods may transfer to the field of depression disorders to construct predictive models and increase the generalizability of the predictive model across the world.

The study is also lacking longitudinal follow-up because the epidemic in China from the outbreak to the control happened quickly. As the global epidemic is prolonged, depression predictions that focus on the longitudinal progression patterns among healthcare workers are worth exploring. Hence, more longitudinal survey “waves” should be carried out to capture time-series information on potential risk predictors. Su et al. (60) did 5 waves of the same survey that aimed to develop machine learning predictive models on depression symptoms among elderly people. The survey contains the exact same categories of questions such as demographics and health-related risk factors. The long short-term memory model was used to predict the values of predictors in the next 2 years, then 6 machine learning models were applied to make depression symptoms predictions. The novelty of longitudinal survey study is it allows machine learning models to merge and characterize the complex interaction between time patterns and predictors. Such successful capture of correlation between static data (predictors) and dynamic data (time) can extend the prediction scope from real-time outcome prediction to outcome's future tendency prediction. If the same longitudinal survey could be done for healthcare workers, it will give researchers opportunities to learn about future depression tendencies influenced by COVID-19 and the progression mechanism between important predictors and depression symptoms in the flow of time.

Last but not the least, future application of machine learning models in predicting depression symptoms in general diagnostic settings remains unclear. Doctors may still prefer making diagnostic decisions based on more traditional criteria. The “black box” nature of machine learning algorithms is sometimes difficult to interpret irrelevant psychological factors. It should also be recognized that the rule played by the machine learning-based predictions model is the decision support system. Machine learning-based predictions model can capture valuable predictors out of high dimensional information provided to psychiatrists and doctors at the outbreak of public health emergency.

Conclusion
This study shows that machine learning prediction models are suitable for making mentally at-risk healthcare worker predictions in a public health emergency setting. As the COVID-19 pandemic change the way people live and work: minimal contact, strict working condition, and growing media influences; the “psychological first aid” can be focused on preparing immediate noncontact psychological consulting material (both paper-based and media-based); and controlling media consumption time avoiding information overload. The application of machine learning models could support hospitals' and healthcare workers' decision-making on early psychological interventions and proper mental health management. Further study of machine learning models predicting high-risk depression symptoms among healthcare workers in cross-site validation is warranted."
Machine learning-based predictive modeling of depression in hypertensive populations,"We aimed to develop prediction models for depression among U.S. adults with hypertension using various machine learning (ML) approaches. Moreover, we analyzed the mechanisms of the developed models. This cross-sectional study included 8,628 adults with hypertension (11.3% with depression) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011–2020). We selected several significant features using feature selection methods to build the models. Data imbalance was managed with random down-sampling. Six different ML classification methods implemented in the R package caret—artificial neural network, random forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting, XGBoost, and support vector machine—were employed with 10-fold cross-validation for predictions. Model performance was assessed by examining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. For an interpretable algorithm, we used the variable importance evaluation function in caret. Of all classification models, artificial neural network trained with selected features (n = 30) achieved the highest AUC (0.813) and specificity (0.780) in predicting depression. Support vector machine predicted depression with the highest accuracy (0.771), precision (0.969), sensitivity (0.774), and F1-score (0.860). The most frequent and important features contributing to the models included the ratio of family income to poverty, triglyceride level, white blood cell count, age, sleep disorder status, the presence of arthritis, hemoglobin level, marital status, and education level. In conclusion, ML algorithms performed comparably in predicting depression among hypertensive populations. Furthermore, the developed models shed light on variables’ relative importance, paving the way for further clinical research.  2022 Lee, Kim.

ANN specifically achieved the highest performance in terms of AUC and specificity. Few studies that have evaluated ANN-based models for predicting psychiatric illnesses have consistently outperformed conventional ML methods and traditional regression models [5, 25, 26]. Our findings add to the evidence of ANN models’ power as computational tools for early diagnosis of depression in individuals with chronic conditions. Nevertheless, although not directly comparable, our ANN model’s predictive ability was comparably lower than that found in previous ML studies, in which AUC values ranged from 0.910 to 0.920 [5] or equal to 0.913 [27].

Notably, SVM also exhibited strong predictive performance with respect to other diagnostic measures, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score. SVM has recently gained crucial importance as neural network approaches for predicting the diagnosis and prognosis of a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression [28–30]. Of note, the SVM has a high predictive accuracy when using large biomedical datasets comprising a small number of records with a large number of variables (i.e., insensitivity to high-dimensional data) and is less affected by imbalanced datasets [23, 31], making it suitable for our analysis. However, SVMs do not always show a high predictive accuracy; in several papers, RF-based models have been reported to perform equally well or better than other algorithms [32–36]. For instance, in the studies by Mousavian et al. [33] and de Souza Filho et al. [34], RF outperformed SVM in predicting depression. Similarly, RF had the best accuracy in predicting anxiety, depression, and stress in the study by Priya et al. [35].

The ratio of family income to poverty was the most important feature across all models. This result accords with findings of recent ML studies [4, 37], which reported the ratio of family income to poverty (or family income itself) as the most crucial feature in predicting depression among community-dwelling adults. Kang and Kim [38] also have noted that the associations of hypertension with symptoms and diagnosis of depression differ by income level. In addition to income, factors such as age, marital status, education—all of which are “social determinants of mental health,” per Carod-Artal [39]—were also among the most important features across the models. Age has consistently been identified as a critical factor in explaining the variability in depression prevalence rates [40]. Marital status is one of the most important social factors affecting various life outcomes, especially mental health [39]. Education strongly affects depression as it heightens cognitive ability, provides economic and social resources, and leads to positive health behaviors [41]. Based on our results, we recommend that, in addition to the usual variables, healthcare providers collect information regarding these social determinants at the earliest possible opportunity to prevent depression and to screen individuals with hypertension for depression risk.

We identified several important biomarkers across the model: triglycerides, white blood cell count, and hemoglobin. In Lin et al.’s study [4] using random forest, triglycerides were an essential variable in building a depression prediction model that included the general population and individuals with a high body mass index. Sharma and Verbeke [14] observed that triglycerides were an important biomarker for diagnosing and distinguishing depression cases from healthy cases using the XGBoost algorithm. Moreover, non-ML studies demonstrate that higher depression scores are associated with an enhanced inflammatory state, as evidenced by higher levels of hematological inflammatory markers including white blood cells, both in individuals free of disease [42] and those with stable heart disease [43]. Finally, among less known modifiable risk factors for depression, anemia has attracted increasing attention. Anemia is often associated with conditions (e.g., cancer, chronic renal failure, malnutrition, etc.) that usually precede depressed mood [44]. Symptoms of low hemoglobin levels (e.g., paleness, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath during physical activity, etc.) also frequently occur alongside depressive symptoms [45]. Some have proposed that anemia has a pathophysiological role in depression due to chronic hypo-oxygenation [46, 47], which further supports the importance of including hemoglobin levels in our model.

Sleep disorder status was also important in building the predictive model. Disturbed sleep is associated with metabolic, neuroendocrine, and inflammatory changes, resulting in alterations to mental functioning [48]. Ma and Li [49] have also reported a significant correlation between sleep quality and depression in older patients with hypertension. Of note, assessment of sleep disorders in individuals with hypertension pertain is important not only for preventing comorbid debilitating mental health disorders but also for mitigating their adverse influence on hypertension management. According to one hypotheses, sleep alterations may impair adaptation to stress through allostasis and contribute to allostatic load, thereby compromising stress resiliency and amplifying blood pressure [50]. Faraut et al. [51] found that participants with short and long-sleep durations were more likely to have depressive symptoms, higher social vulnerability, and higher hypertension rates. One limitation in our interpretation is that the type of sleep disorder was not reported in the NHANES survey. Therefore, we could not explore the specific association between different sleep disorders and depression in the population with hypertension, which should be addressed in future studies. Such information may have helped derive more precise insights in preventing depression in our target population.

Lastly, arthritis was among our models’ most important features. It has long been recognized that arthritis and depression are associated [52]. Individuals with arthritis fear long-term pain, loss of function, work disability, and possible socioeconomic effects of the disease [53]. With these rational fears and physical challenges, most patients with arthritis exhibit clinically significant levels of low self-esteem and self-stigma, which explains the high prevalence of depressive disorders among these patients [54, 55]. Of importance, depression and arthritis increase the burden on the healthcare system, with increased provider visits, more pain complaints, and increased requests for pain medication that complicates hypertension management [56]. Therefore, greater primary preventive effort for depression should be directed toward individuals with hypertension and arthritis; for instance, administering routine depression screening.

Limitations and implications
Our study has several limitations. First, although our ANN and SVM models evidently provided the best performance on the test set with the highest AUC and F1-score, the clinical utility of the models remains speculative at this stage. This is mainly because our results were based on self-reported data: the diagnosis of depression was based on a self-reported questionnaire in the present study without validation using actual clinical records or direct patient examination. In addition, our sample size was relatively small compared to other population studies. By building a more extensive database for training a prediction model, the variations observed among adults with depression can be more thoroughly incorporated. In the future, this may result in models with true clinical utility. Second, associations between inputs and outputs for predictive modeling do not infer causal relationships as the current study used cross-sectional data; for instance, the relationship between arthritis and depression may have been bidirectional. Another limitation is the inability of most ML algorithms to account for complex survey designs with multi-stage stratified sampling, which is often used for household surveys like the NHANES. Therefore, our sample should not be considered a true representative of community-dwelling adults with depression between 2011–2020.

Finally, recognizing the limitations of prevalence analyses is important. For instance, in the current study, the estimates of hypertension prevalence were drawn from many sources including survey data. However, an isolated survey response does not guarantee the diagnosis of the disease. In addition, antihypertensive medications can be prescribed to patients without hypertension; for example, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Accordingly, some samples included in the study may not have been representative of the population we targeted. Furthermore, the results should be interpreted cautiously since prevalence data alone cannot completely explain the disease dynamics. For example, in the case of a sleep disorder, a participant could have returned to sleep normalcy after medical treatment. Therefore, the question about the prevalence of sleep disorder does not assess whether the patient continued to have a sleeping disorder. Despite its limitations, this study is the first to predict depression among hypertensive populations using multiple ML approaches. This study also presents a potential method to aid the preliminary screening of depression among patients with hypertension, before a formal clinical diagnosis.

Several implications should be considered. First, our use of cross-sectional data to evaluate the ML models may have introduced bias in performance estimation, as the ML models’ performance should ideally be evaluated on newly collected data or a separate dataset for reliability. Further studies should address this limitation. Second, apart from including traditional risk factors, including different types of inputs could help further improve depression prediction [34]. For example, we did not include quality of life variables, such as familial relationships, social relationships, or leisure activity, which can help in better predicting depression prediction [37], owing to the fundamental limitations of the original NHANES survey. Third, the models developed in this study determined the variables’ predictive importance, facilitating additional clinical research; for instance, the strongest features across the models could be used to further improve depression prediction in future studies. Finally, a larger volume of data from the healthy population would be preferrable. With larger datasets, the methods employed will begin to vary and demonstrate improved validity [10]: particularly, the feature selection methods will improve performance, as they are likely to be affected by sample size; in addition, the k-fold cross-validation method can be utilized with larger k-values instead of the leave-one-out method to allow for larger sets on which to test prediction models and improve models’ generalizability.

Conclusion
In the current study, ML algorithms performed comparably in predicting depression among U.S. adults with hypertension. Models with superior performance may aid in developing screening tools for depression among hypertensive adults in future studies. Furthermore, the risk factors for depression identified across the models may inform healthcare professionals to devise effective prevention strategies by focusing on at-risk individuals and may assist patients with hypertension with decisions regarding the use of diagnostic testing, treatments, or lifestyle changes."
Machine learning-based predictive modeling of postpartum depression,"Postpartum depression is a serious health issue beyond the mental health problems that affect mothers after childbirth. There are no predictive tools available to screen postpartum depression that also allow early interventions. We aimed to develop predictive models for postpartum depression using machine learning (ML) approaches. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2012–2013 with 28,755 records (3339 postpartum depression and 25,416 normal cases). The imbalance between the two groups was addressed by a balanced resampling using both random down-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique. Nine different ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting, support vector machines (SVM), recursive partitioning and regression trees, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), logistic regression, and neural network, were employed with 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models. The overall classification accuracies of the nine models ranged from 0.650 (kNN) to 0.791 (RF). The RF method achieved the highest area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.884, followed by SVM, which achieved the second-best performance with an AUC value of 0.864. Predictive modeling developed using ML-approaches may thus be used as a prediction (screening) tool for postpartum depression in future studies.  2020 by the authors.

Mothers aged ≤ 19 years had increased odds of having postpartum depression, as did mothers with education of 0–12 years and 13–15 years and small-for-gestational-age infants. Those with depression before pregnancy, those who reduced cigarette smoking from the last three months of pregnancy to postpartum period and those who were unmarried had increased odds of having postpartum depression. In contrast to our finding, for adult mothers over the age of 25 had increased odds of having postpartum depressive symptoms [18].
In this study, prenatal depression was associated with postpartum depressive symptoms; the high prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation during adolescence and young adulthood may reflect family societal pressure on women to achieve high academic standards and perform traditional gender roles [32,33]. The preference for a male infant is one of the significant determinants for postpartum depression in Indian [34] and Chinese women [35,36]. The increased risk for postpartum depression among women with female infants could be explained by poor postnatal support from family members, especially husbands and parents [37]. In our study, top features returned by our machine learning-based models included exposure to stress during pregnancy, having depression before pregnancy, weeks spent breastfeeding the baby, income, dental hygiene before pregnancy, and the gender of the baby. Life stress and a history of depression and have been the most significant predictors for postpartum depression [38]. In particular, exposure to stress changes the levels of hormones in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, especially cortisol level, and depressed individuals demonstrate abnormal HPA axis function by releasing high levels of cortisol [39,40]. Also, women’s oral health may influence many pregnancy outcomes beyond postpartum depression. Maternal periodontal disease has been linked to low birth weight and preterm birth [41,42].
Even though the present study did not explore the gender of the infant, this previous finding may be relevant to our study, in that Asian mothers may have displayed a high prevalence of postpartum depression with a female infant. In our study, unmarried mothers had increased odds of having postpartum depression (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12–1.43). This finding is consistent with a previous report, where unmarried women had significant odds of having postpartum depressive symptoms in the Rhode Island-specific PRAMS 2004–2008 [18]. This study suggests that marital status is associated with experiencing postpartum depression, which is consistent with our study findings.
Regarding ML classifiers, our study found that RF achieved the best performances for predicting postpartum depression, with a classification accuracy value of 0.791 and an AUC value of 0.884, respectively. Similar to our study findings, one study using data from the Rhode Island PRAMS [18] developed a forward selection-based predictive model for postpartum depression, which achieved an AUC value of 0.79. The risk factors included pregnancy intention, race, stress, economic status, and social support. Tortajada et al. developed another prediction model for postpartum depression using multilayer perceptrons and pruning for pregnant Spanish women using data from seven Spanish general hospitals from 2003–2004 [43]. Their approach of using multilayer perceptrons showed good performance for prediction of postpartum depression, where the best model (the subject model with no pruning) achieved a sensitivity of 0.84, a specificity of 0.81, and an AUC value of 0.82. Using 45 Iranian depressive patients and 45 normal subjects, Hosseinifard et al. [44] employed logistic regression classifiers that achieved the highest classification accuracy of 83.3%. Combining multiple algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), and kNN, the accuracy of classification was improved by 6.7%, reaching an overall accuracy of 90%. Jimenez-Serrano et al. [45] employed NB, logistic regression, SVM, and artificial neural network (ANN) methods, where NB achieved the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. In their modeling, logistic regression achieved the highest AUC value of 0.77. Compared with these previous modeling studies, our ML models demonstrated comparable or better overall prediction performance. It is worthy of note that the best performing algorithms in this study are known to have implicit feature selection processes and will usually select their own best set of predictive features.
Our study demonstrates several strengths. First, PRAMS collects state-specific, population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy in a standardized data collection methodology [46] and covers 83% of all U.S. births [47]. Furthermore, a number of significant features were selected in a data-driven approach to building the ML-based prediction models.
Despite these strengths, there are also a few limitations. Postpartum depression was based on mothers’ self-reports, rather than a medical diagnosis; therefore, there may be information bias. There was a lot of missing data on sociodemographic and lifestyle variables in this study (n = 28,755 vs. 72,540), and it is possible that the results in the non-response or missing population could differ from those of the response population. PHQ-2 was used to diagnose postpartum depression. PHQ-2 is a screening tool that measures the presence of symptoms consistent with major depression but does not indicate the etiologies of postpartum depression although knowing the etiologies of postpartum depression is significant for a comprehensive diagnostic process of postpartum depression [48]. PHQ-2 includes two items from the PHQ-9 regarding the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks as a first-step approach, and it is not intended to reveal the severity of depression nor used as the final diagnosis of depression. Patients who screen positive from the PHQ-2 should be further evaluated with the PHQ-9 to determine whether they are diagnosed with a depressive disorder [49].
We used the SMOTE oversampling approach to address the strong imbalance between the healthy and depression group. To ensure that we do not overfit the models, we used a cross-validation approach to model building. We also randomly divided the available dataset into three distinct datasets and treated each one independent of the other. Nevertheless, further evaluation of the models using an independent cohort would be needed. While our current approach employs traditional machine learning methods, an application of advanced artificial neural network architecture integrating electronic health records needs to be explored in the future [50]. We will employ ensemble methods, combining the outcomes of multiple ML methods into one, to improve the prediction of our models. We will also further reduce the number of features to the most relevant ones while keeping the high prediction performance and will evaluate simple-to-use nomograms based on our models for clinical use.
Additionally, we observed that some well-known features suggested by the literature were excluded from our final models. These features have been reported by previous literature [9,18,28,29,30,31] to be highly-correlated with depression but automatically removed in our study because they had a lot of missing values in the original data. For example, women whose babies were dead at the time of responding to the survey were seven times more likely to develop postpartum depression (Table S6). Unfortunately, the feature corresponding to this response was removed due to our data-cleansing approach. Future directions in this study will involve making extensive use of these sparse features that have a high correlation with the development of postpartum depression. Lastly, even though we used maternal inputs for predictive modeling since postpartum depression varies across racial and ethnic groups, we could not consider cultural variations in the experiences and expression of emotional distress that may lead to the under detection of misidentification of postpartum depression [51]."
Machine learning_based identification and related features of depression in patients with diabetes mellitus based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: A cross-sectional study,"Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are twice as likely as nondiabetic individuals to develop depression, which is a prevalent but often undiagnosed psychiatric comorbidity. Patients with DM who are depressed have poor glycemic control, worse quality of life, increased risk of diabetic complications, and higher mortality rate. The present study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) models that identify depression in patients with DM, determine the best performing model by evaluating multiple ML algorithms, and investigate features related to depression. We developed six ML models, including random forest, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting, light gradient-boosting machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The results showed that the SVM model performed well, with a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.835 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.730–0.901). Thirteen features were related to depression in patients with DM. Permutation feature importance showed that the most important feature was subjective health status, followed by level of general stress awareness; stress recognition rate; average monthly income; triglyceride (mg/dL) level; activity restriction status; European quality of life (EuroQoL): usual activity and lying in a sickbed in the past 1 month; EuroQoL: pain / discomfort, self-care, and physical discomfort in the last 2 weeks; and EuroQoL: mobility and chewing problems. The current findings may offer clinicians a better understanding of the relationship between DM and depression using ML approaches and may be an initial step toward developing a more predictive model for the early detection of depressive symptoms in patients with DM.","This study aimed to create ML models that can identify depression in patients with DM and to determine the best-performing model by assessing multiple ML algorithms while investigating features related to depression. The results showed that the SVM model had the best performance (cross-validated AUC, 0.835). The following 13 features were identified as important for classifying depression in patients with DM: subjective health status, followed by level of general stress awareness; stress recognition rate; average monthly income; triglyceride level (mg/dL); activity restriction status; EuroQoL: usual activity and lying in a sickbed in the past 1 month; EuroQoL: pain / discomfort, self-care, and physical discomfort in the last 2 weeks; and EuroQoL: mobility and chewing problems.Permutation feature importance revealed that subjective health status was the most significant features of the model. A previous study demonstrated that patients with diabetes had lower self-perceived health, psychological well-being, and quality of life compared with those without diabetes. Factors that contribute to this include being female, having depression, not exercising, and being obese [25]. Another study indicated a weak relationship between HbA1c level and quality of life. However, symptoms of depression in T2DM are associated with a significantly worse health status and quality of life [26]. Thus, the importance of caring for both DM and depression lies in improving individuals’ quality of life and perception of their health status. The current findings, which include a large sample size and the use of ML algorithms, support the findings of previous studies.The present ML model suggests that stress awareness and average monthly income are important features for classifying depression in individuals with diabetes. Being diagnosed with diabetes, planning suicide for a year, receiving counseling for mental problems for a year, and being aware of stress significantly impacted the level of depression [27]. The risk of DM is significantly higher in lower-income groups than in higher-income groups [28]. Additionally, lower personal income was associated with major depression and depressive symptoms among adults with DM [29]. A Danish nationwide study revealed the notable prevalence of emotional problems among adults with early-onset T2DM [30]. The primary cause of those problems was attributed to perceived stress or depressive symptoms linked to socio-economic factors such as unemployment, low education level, and living alone. The ML model confirms that stress awareness and average monthly income are important features for classifying depression in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize specialized care for stress management, considering the social status of individuals, to address both diabetes and depressive symptoms effectively. Another important feature to classify depression in patients with DM is activity restrictions, including quality of life in usual activity, lying in a sickbed in the past 1 month, and activity restriction status. DM and depression generally have a negative effect on patient-initiated activities, such as less physical activity, unhealthy diet, and lower adherence to oral medications [31]. According to a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, higher levels of physical activity were associated with a substantially lower incidence of T2DM in the general population [32]. We found that patients with diabetic complications were less likely to engage in physical activity and had poorer self-rated health compared with those without complications. In particular, the presence of DM complications, such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, foot ulceration, retinopathy, and nephropathy, can make it challenging to meet the recommended exercise [33]. Consequently, patients with DM fail to engage in appropriate self-care behaviors, including proper physical activity, because of their symptoms and complications, and less physical activity may increase the risk of depression. However, our results do not support a causal relationship between DM and depression. Further longitudinal studies are required to understand the mechanisms and causal directions of activity restriction and depression. However, when developing treatment plans for depression in patients with DM, it is essential to address both the underlying causes of activity restriction and the resulting effects on mental health. Although comparing the performance of our models may be challenging owing to dataset and analysis variations, classifying depression among patients with DM showed improved performance. The SVM algorithm had an AUC of 83.5% and an ACC of 87.9%. In a previous ML study, the AUC of logistic regression model was 81% [8], and another study showed that the model using SVM had an ACC of 96.875% to classify depression among patients with T2DM [9]. Furthermore, our model’s strengths lie in its potential for expansion. The KNHANES is conducted annually; therefore, our model can incorporate additional features or new data for future research or practical applications. Additionally, Boruta, an algorithm-based technique, was employed for feature selection in our ML model. It can be beneficial for recommending approaches for developing ML models to diagnose other complications associated with DM. The present dataset was cross-sectional, and there are limitations in understanding the progressive pathways of depression. According to Park, Katon [34], patients with DM who are depressed have a considerably higher risk of death, and early identification and treatment of depression may enhance health outcomes. Further studies using longitudinal data are necessary to develop a model for detecting and predicting the early stages of depression in patients with DM. Nonetheless, the results of the present study, based on various features and a larger sample size, may serve as an initial step for the development of an ML model for predicting depression at an early stage among patients with DM. The present study has some limitations. First, the KNHANES is a cross-sectional study; therefore, we could not measure the prognosis of the disease or future occurrence of depression in the sample, and the description of the causal effect is limited. Second, we acknowledge the absence of an external validation set in the present study. However, KNHANES is a cross-sectional national survey conducted annually. Therefore, in future research, it would be beneficial to utilize upcoming datasets from KNHANES for validating our model. Third, the definitions of DM and depression relied on self-reporting. Forth, patients with T1DM could be included in this study. The KNHANES does not have a question about DM type; we eliminated patients with DM who were diagnosed before the age of 30 years. Further studies are required to determine the relationship between DM and depression in patients with T1DM.Despite these limitations, the present study aimed to develop ML models that diagnose depression in patients with DM based on the KNHANES, to determine the best performing model by evaluating multiple ML algorithms, and to investigate features related to depression."
mHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study,"Introduction Depression and diabetes are highly disabling diseases with a high prevalence and high rate of comorbidity, particularly in low-income ethnic minority patients. Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual’s behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention.Methods and analysis In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18–75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up. Ethics and dissemination the Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608). We plan to submit manuscripts describing our user-designed methods and testing of the adaptive learning algorithm and will submit the results of the trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at (inter)-national scientific meetings.","In this randomised controlled trial, we aim to examine the effect of a smartphone app that uses RL to predict the most effective messages for increasing PA in 276 low-income, ethnic and racial minority patients with diabetes and depression in urban public sector primary care clinics. We will compare this intervention to uniform random messages, delivered with equal and unchanging probabilities, and a control group that only receives a weekly mood message.Decreasing health disparities Though the numbers of mHealth pilot studies are increasing in vulnerable populations, many of these fail to follow through with an implementation component to the study design.42 Here, we are using a blended design: while the intervention is in addition to current care, there are ways we are attempting to make it more a part of patients’ clinical care. For instance, patients are mainly approached through primary care health providers, which recommend eligible patients whom they think are directly interested in a PA intervention. In addition, we will make patients’ data available to providers: a summary of the step increase for that patient at the conclusion of the study and updated PHQ-8 and GAD scores entered into the record. Our study therefore is the first step to addressing this gap because of its integration in primary care clinics that serve low-income patients. Future work should focus more specifically on implementation of the app as part of routine clinical care. We chose passively collected daily step count from patients’ preowned digital devices as a measure of PA. Although there are many different ways to measure PA, daily step count seems to be a particularly relevant measure because of: (1) its relative ease to measure, and (2) the clinical importance of individuals’ walking behaviour. Low number of daily step counts have been associated with all-cause mortality in some longitudinal studies43 and results from pooled population studies show clear dose–response effects of PA to overall mortality.44 In patients with type 2 diabetes, several studies have now shown that increasing step counts can significantly decrease HbA1c levels. For instance, a 10_000 steps per day walking prescription increased steps and decreased HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes.45 Further, Manjoo et al found that each SD increase in daily steps was associated with a 0.21% decrease in HbA1c.46 However, negative findings have also been reported. For instance, a meta-analysis by Qiu et al found that step-counter use was associated with increased steps per day (over 1800 more steps compared with a control group) among people with diabetes, but not with lowering of HbA1c.47 In exploratory post hoc analyses, we will also be able to examine the more immediate effect of PA messages, for example, on hourly steps in addition to daily steps, which will help to improve future PA interventions (eg, deliver messages at the right times). For instance, it is possible that one could receive a message in the morning and make plans to walk in the afternoon or evening, or messages could have more of an immediate impact. This information is currently unknown. Personalisation of intervention The results of this RCT will help us understand if adaptive mHealth interventions for depression and diabetes are more beneficial than interventions that do not use learning algorithms. If mHealth interventions are not personalised, their efficacy might be low, due to low engagement and high drop-out rates.20 The use of machine learning to adapt interventions according to users’ characteristics and behaviours is still in its early stages, but shows promise.48 For instance, Yov-Tom et al using an adaptive learning algorithm found that adaptive feedback messages were more effective in increasing the amount and speed of PA and also reduced HbA1c in sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes.33 Further, Zhou et al showed short-term efficacy of using adaptive weekly step goals determined by RL in healthy patients.49 The current study, with a relatively large group of patients, will further increase our understanding of the potential of machine-learning-driven text-messaging interventions."
Modifiable predictors of nonresponse to psychotherapies for late-life depression with executive dysfunction: a machine learning approach,"The study aimed to: (1) Identify distinct trajectories of change in depressive symptoms by mid-treatment during psychotherapy for late-life depression with executive dysfunction; (2) examine if nonresponse by mid-treatment predicted poor response at treatment end; and (3) identify baseline characteristics predicting an early nonresponse trajectory by mid-treatment. A sample of 221 adults 60 years and older with major depression and executive dysfunction were randomized to 12 weeks of either problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy. We used Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMM) to detect subgroups with distinct trajectories of change in depression by mid-treatment (6th week). We conducted regression analyses with LGMM subgroups as predictors of response at treatment end. We used random forest machine learning algorithms to identify baseline predictors of LGMM trajectories. We found that ~77.5% of participants had a declining trajectory of depression in weeks 0–6, while the remaining 22.5% had a persisting depression trajectory, with no treatment differences. The LGMM trajectories predicted remission and response at treatment end. A random forests model with high prediction accuracy (80%) showed that the strongest modifiable predictors of the persisting depression trajectory were low perceived social support, followed by high neuroticism, low treatment expectancy, and low perception of the therapist as accepting. Our results suggest that modifiable risk factors of early nonresponse to psychotherapy can be identified at the outset of treatment and addressed with targeted personalized interventions. Therapists may focus on increasing meaningful social interactions, addressing concerns related to treatment benefits, and creating a positive working relationship.  2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Slow improvement of depression by the sixth session of psychotherapy predicts poor outcomes at treatment end (week 12) in older patients with major depression and executive dysfunction. High severity of depression, perceived low social support, neuroticism, low expectations of improvement, younger age, and the perception of therapist as less accepting were the strongest predictors of slow change of depression during the first 6 weeks of psychotherapy. Modifiable risk factors for poor response to psychotherapy may be targeted early in treatment with appropriately selected interventions and improve treatment outcomes.

Low perceived social support was the strongest modifiable predictor of early risk of nonresponse to psychotherapy. The perception of low social support is a risk factor for development of late-life depression [27]. Primary care patients who perceived their social relationships as unsupportive had less improvement of depression in response to psychosocial interventions than patients who perceived their environment as supportive [28]. Low perceived social support may be due to depression-related cognitive distortions of the support by others or due to the true absence of positive social interactions. Engagement of depressed older adults in rewarding social interactions with significant others predicted increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression during “Engage,” a reward exposure psychotherapy [29]. Patients’ negative misperceptions can be addressed through simple cognitive interventions aimed to reduce negativity bias, common in late-life depression [30]. Clinicians can also involve family members in treatment to facilitate social support and increase patients’ access to social activities available in the community.

Neuroticism also predicted early nonresponse to psychotherapy. High overall neuroticism is associated with increased risk for development of depression in older adults [31], and low remission rates during treatment with sertraline [32]. Neuroticism is also associated with volume loss and hypermetabolism in threat perception brain structures in adults [33].

Negative treatment expectancy at the outset predicted minimal response by mid-treatment. This finding is consistent with the results of a meta-analysis, which included 8016 patients, and documented that negative treatment expectancy is associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes [34]. The relationship of therapist perception to early response to psychotherapy is in line with meta-analysis findings in depressed younger adults [35]. It is also consistent with meta-analyses demonstrating that nonspecific therapeutic components, such as the therapeutic relationship, are associated with treatment response across psychotherapies [36, 37].

The observation that early nonresponders to psychotherapy have high severity of depression at baseline parallels findings of classical studies [38], although a recent meta-analysis did not confirm the relationship of severity of depression to psychotherapy response [39]. Older age was a predictor of early response to psychotherapy, an observation consistent with findings showing that psychotherapy in older adults is at least as effective as in younger adults [39]. The type of psychotherapy (PST vs. ST) was not significantly associated with early response. This is not surprising since our PST and ST treated participants had similar trajectories of depression decline until the 6th week of treatment but PST led to a sharper depression decline after that point [6].

The classification tree of the strongest predictors of early response offers a nuanced clinical view of early response prediction (Fig. 3). Depressed patients who perceived their relationships with others as supportive had a high probability of early response. Even among participants with low perceived social support, those with high treatment expectancy had a high probability of early response, especially if they had low neuroticism scores. Among participants with low perceived social support and low expectations for improvement, those with low neuroticism were likely to have an early response to psychotherapy.

The perception of social support, the patient’s expectations of therapy, and the patients’ view of their therapist are all modifiable clinical factors. Systematic exposure to rewarding interactions with significant others may reduce depressive symptoms [29]. When needed, therapists may address behavioral and social skill deficits and cognitive factors that contribute to the perception or maintenance of unsatisfying levels of social support. These approaches have been shown to improve both the perception of social support and the experience of depressive symptoms [40]. Reinforcing realistic, positive treatment expectancy and addressing negative views about therapy and its outcomes early in treatment may improve outcomes. Therapists may explore patient perceptions of the therapuetic relationship early in treatment and project an accepting attitude. Neuroticism is a trait leading to disproportional emotional responses to stressors. Even though neuroticism persists, its impact may be reduced through stress management approaches and mindfulness-based interventions [41].

This study has several limitations. Therapists were trained and offered both PST and ST. This design might have introduced a therapist preference bias if therapists favored one of the two treatments. This bias was mitigated by selecting therapists without previous experience in either treatment, by offering training and by continuously monitoring treatment fidelity. Another limitation is the reliance on interviewer-rated measures for all variables of interest, with the exception of executive dysfunction. We acknowledge that objective and performance-based measures are preferable when available. Further, our sample was well educated (mean of 15 years), limiting the generalizability of our finding to this subpopulation. Missing data in 12-week outcomes and baseline predictors is a limitation of this study. However, sensitivity analyses suggested that patterns of missing data did not bias our results. Further, 91% of those who started treatment remained in treatment until the end of the trial. Our study focused on identifying predictors of response to PST and ST in depression accompanied by executive dysfunction. Lack of a comparable analysis in depressed older adults without executive dysfunction prevents any conclusion on the generalizability of our findings to late-life, major depression without executive dysfunction. The absence of a treatment effect in our study suggests that these predictors may be relevant to other psychotherapy models. However, future focused studies will be needed to empirically test this assertion. Similarly, future studies could investigate whether early modification of the predictors identified in this study improves treatment response. In addition, our study focused on early risk of nonresponse. Future studies may expand this inquiry into predictors of relapse and recurrence after attainment of remission. Management of suicide risk is important with this vulnerable population. Exploratory analysis showed that random forest and classification tree with an outcome variable of the suicidal ideation item of the HAM-D at baseline identified three of our five predictors as most important: perceived social support (most important predictor), neuroticism, and perception of the therapist as accepting. Active suicidal ideation (i.e. plan or intent in the near future) was an exclusion criterion in this trial and, therefore, we focused our inquiry on depression severity as an outcome.

Finally, the random forest algorithm models complex nonlinear relationships between predictors but renders an opaque prediction algorithm. For this reason, we have presented a clinically useful classification tree. While overfitting is a potential problem in sample sizes similar to ours, it may not have affected our results given the large number of patients compared to predictors in our random forests tree analysis and the large number of trees included and pruned in the classification tree.

In conclusion, we observed that a trajectory of depression nonresponse detected by week 6 predicts poor response at treatment end. Predictors of early nonresponse include severity of depression, low perceived social support, high neuroticism, low treatment expectancy, younger age and perception of the therapist as less accepting. Modifiable predictors identified early in therapy can be addressed with targeted interventions. Encouraging rewarding meaningful social interactions may increase the perception of social support. Emotion regulation, stress management, mindfulness, and anxiety reduction techniques may be helpful in patients with high neuroticism. Clarifying the mechanisms of treatment, conveying realistic optimism about treatment efficacy, assuming an accepting, noncritical stance, and facilitating a strong therapeutic relationship may address the remaining modifiable risk factors of early nonresponse and improve treatment outcomes."
Modifiable predictors of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy for late-life major depression. A machine learning approach,"This study aimed to identify subgroups of depressed older adults with distinct trajectories of suicidal ideation during brief psychotherapy and to detect modifiable predictors of membership to the trajectories of suicidal ideation. Latent growth mixed models were used to identify trajectories of the presence of suicidal ideation in participants to a randomized controlled trial comparing Problem Solving Therapy with “Engage” therapy in older adults with major depression over 9 weeks. Predictors of membership to trajectories of suicidal ideation were identified by the convergence of four machine learning models, i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and classification tree. The course of suicidal ideation was best captured by two trajectories, a favorable and an unfavorable trajectory comprising 173 and 76 participants respectively. Members of the favorable trajectory had no suicidal ideation by week 8. In contrast, members of the unfavorable trajectory had a 60% probability of suicidal ideation by treatment end. Convergent findings of the four machine learning models identified hopelessness, neuroticism, and low general self-efficacy as the strongest predictors of membership to the unfavorable trajectory of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy. Assessment of suicide risk should include hopelessness, neuroticism, and general self-efficacy as they are predictors of an unfavorable course of suicidal ideation in depressed older adults receiving psychotherapy. Psychotherapeutic interventions exist for hopelessness, emotional reactivity related to neuroticism, and low self-efficacy, and if used during therapy, may improve the course of suicidal ideation.  2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","The principal finding of this study is that the presence of suicidal ideation followed two distinct trajectories during treatment of late-life major depression with either “Engage” or PST. Approximately 31% (76/249) of depressed participants had an unfavorable trajectory of suicidal ideation and 69% (173/249) had a favorable trajectory leading to the absence of any suicidal ideation prior to treatment end. There was only partial overlap of the trajectories of suicidal ideation and the trajectories of depression severity during treatment. Converging information from four machine learning algorithms identified hopelessness, neuroticism, and low general self-efficacy at treatment start as the strongest predictors of an unfavorable trajectory of suicidal ideation. There was no significant difference in the course of suicidal ideation between “Engage”-treated and PST-treated patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe distinct trajectories of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy of late-life major depression and identify modifiable predictors. A small number of potent, modifiable predictors of the course of suicidal ideation can focus clinical assessment and inform the selection of psychotherapeutic interventions.

Hopelessness emerged as the strongest predictor of unfavorable course of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy. This observation is consistent with literature linking suicidal ideation to hopelessness. In a classical study, hopelessness was 1.3 times more likely than the severity of depression to explain suicidal ideation in patients with mood disorders [25]. The ecological momentary assessment showed that, even though hopelessness fluctuates over time, it has a significant association with both passive and active suicidal ideation [26]. Trait hopelessness was shown to have a stronger association with suicidal ideation than hopelessness influenced by depression symptoms [27]. This observation parallels the findings of our study in which hopelessness at baseline, and not the severity of depression, was the strongest predictor of membership to the unfavorable suicidal ideation trajectory.

Neuroticism was another predictor of persistent suicidal ideation in older patients with major depression. Neuroticism is a partially stable trait, characterized by negative affect and increased sensitivity to stress. Neuroimaging studies suggest that neuroticism is associated with impaired functional connectivity of the amygdala with regulatory cortical networks [28]. In large samples, neuroticism was highly correlated with depression in younger and older adults and both the conditions had a substantially overlapping genetic contribution [29]. In addition to its relationship with depression, neuroticism is associated with suicidal ideation [30]. In depressed older adults, neuroticism was a predictor of poor early response to psychotherapy [31], and low remission rates during treatment with sertraline [32].

A low score on general self-efficacy at the outset of treatment predicted an unfavorable course of suicidal ideation. Self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief in his/her ability to deal successfully with prospective situations and reflects confidence in exerting control over his/her environment. Individuals with low self-efficacy do not believe in their ability to change negative outcomes. Consequently, they may isolate and avoid negative situations rather than attempt to solve problems. In patients psychiatrically hospitalized after a suicide crisis, suicide ideation at the worst time point was inversely associated with self-efficacy related to suicide actions [33]. Individuals reporting current suicidal ideation also reported significantly lower levels of self-efficacy than those reporting no current suicidal ideation. Further, individuals with a history of multiple actual, interrupted, and/or aborted suicide attempts reported significantly lower levels of self-efficacy than individuals with a single lifetime attempt.

The classification tree analysis offers a nuanced clinical view of the relationships among the three strongest predictors of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy (Fig. 4). Depressed patients with low hopelessness had a favorable course of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy. Even among participants experiencing hopelessness, suicidal ideation subsided in those with low neuroticism scores. However, among participants with high hopelessness and neuroticism scores, suicidal ideation persisted in those with high general self-efficacy. So, while general self-efficacy predicts the decline of suicidal ideation overall, it was associated with persistent suicidal ideation in depressed patients with neuroticism and hopelessness. Hopelessness and high self-efficacy rarely coexist. Nonetheless, confidence that a person can take control when he/she believes that nothing can work may make suicide appear as an attractive alternative.

Hopelessness, high emotional reactivity related to neuroticism, and self-efficacy are modifiable clinical factors that, if addressed, may improve the course of suicidal ideation. Identifying themes related to hopelessness and training individuals to examine the validity of their assumptions, have been shown to decrease hopelessness [34]. Emotional reactivity associated with neuroticism may respond to targeted interventions. Brief training in mindfulness meditation can increase self-control and improve the function of cognitive control networks [35]. Mindfulness meditation decreased emotional reactivity, reduced amygdala responsiveness, and increased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during affective stimuli [36]. Identification of patient- and situation-specific triggers of negative emotions and addressing them with cognitive reappraisal and strategies for adaptive responses may reduce negative emotions and suicidal ideation in depressed patients with high neuroticism [37]. Finally, several interventions have been shown to increase self-efficacy. These include setting graded tasks, instruction on where, when, and how to perform desirable behaviors, prompt self-monitoring of behavioral outcomes, motivational interviewing [38], and action planning. Many of the above interventions have been part of both “Engage” and PST. Identifying patients with hopelessness, neuroticism, and low self-efficacy early in treatment and targeting them with appropriate strategies may further reduce suicidal ideation and ultimately decrease the risk of suicide.

The study has limitations. Individuals with imminent risk of suicide were excluded and most participants had mild suicidal ideation. However, mild suicidal ideation is more persistent than severe suicidal ideation and requires clinical attention [39]. Depressed elders with passive suicidal ideation are more likely to have a history of suicide attempts, higher scores of hopelessness [40], slower treatment response, and lower rates of response than non-suicidal depressed elders [39]. Passive suicidal ideation has a stronger association with medical comorbidity and service utilization than active suicidal ideation or no suicidal ideation [41]. Finally, 35% of patients with suicidal ideation change ideator status during the index episode; passive ideators become active ideators and vice versa [40]. Another limitation is the small number of executive function tests of our study. Executive dysfunction is a predictor of poor response of depression to pharmacotherapy [42] and may interfere with problem-solving and the performance of treatment assignments during psychotherapy. Similarly, the study did not assess loneliness, social isolation, bereavement, role transitions, interpersonal conflicts, thwarted belongingness, and other interpersonal factors that had been associated with suicidality [43].

Strengths of the study include its rigorous randomized clinical trial design and the high fidelity of therapists to manualized treatments [7]. The strongest predictors of the trajectories of suicidal ideation were identified through concordance of findings by four state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Rigorous estimates of prediction accuracy were obtained by cross-validation to ensure high reproducibility of our prediction model and support the clinical use of hopelessness, neuroticism, and self-efficacy (Fig. 2) as predictors of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy of late-life depression. Finally, classification tree analysis offers a clinical decision rule for predicting the trajectory of suicidal ideation in depressed older adults. However, its findings require replication before introduction into clinical practice.

In conclusion, two trajectories best described the presence of suicidal ideation during psychotherapy of older adults with major depression. While many predictors of suicidal ideation have been reported [43], the convergence of machine learning findings identified three potent predictors (hopelessness, neuroticism, and general self-efficacy) that should not be missed in the assessment of depressed older adults starting psychotherapy. Identifying these predictors early can shape the therapists’ strategy by including interventions targeting hopelessness, emotional reactivity related to neuroticism, and low self-efficacy and improve the course of suicidal ideation in depressed older adults."
Multimodal Machine Learning Workflows for Prediction of Psychosis in Patients with Clinical High-Risk Syndromes and Recent-Onset Depression,"Importance: Diverse models have been developed to predict psychosis in patients with clinical high-risk (CHR) states. Whether prediction can be improved by efficiently combining clinical and biological models and by broadening the risk spectrum to young patients with depressive syndromes remains unclear. Objectives: To evaluate whether psychosis transition can be predicted in patients with CHR or recent-onset depression (ROD) using multimodal machine learning that optimally integrates clinical and neurocognitive data, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia; to assess models' geographic generalizability; to test and integrate clinicians' predictions; and to maximize clinical utility by building a sequential prognostic system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multisite, longitudinal prognostic study performed in 7 academic early recognition services in 5 European countries followed up patients with CHR syndromes or ROD and healthy volunteers. The referred sample of 167 patients with CHR syndromes and 167 with ROD was recruited from February 1, 2014, to May 31, 2017, of whom 26 (23 with CHR syndromes and 3 with ROD) developed psychosis. Patients with 18-month follow-up (n = 246) were used for model training and leave-one-site-out cross-validation. The remaining 88 patients with nontransition served as the validation of model specificity. Three hundred thirty-four healthy volunteers provided a normative sample for prognostic signature evaluation. Three independent Swiss projects contributed a further 45 cases with psychosis transition and 600 with nontransition for the external validation of clinical-neurocognitive, sMRI-based, and combined models. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Accuracy and generalizability of prognostic systems. Results: A total of 668 individuals (334 patients and 334 controls) were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 25.1 [5.8] years; 354 [53.0%] female and 314 [47.0%] male). Clinicians attained a balanced accuracy of 73.2% by effectively ruling out (specificity, 84.9%) but ineffectively ruling in (sensitivity, 61.5%) psychosis transition. In contrast, algorithms showed high sensitivity (76.0%-88.0%) but low specificity (53.5%-66.8%). A cybernetic risk calculator combining all algorithmic and human components predicted psychosis with a balanced accuracy of 85.5% (sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 86.4%). In comparison, an optimal prognostic workflow produced a balanced accuracy of 85.9% (sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 87.3%) at a much lower diagnostic burden by sequentially integrating clinical-neurocognitive, expert-based, PRS-based, and sMRI-based risk estimates as needed for the given patient. Findings were supported by good external validation results. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that psychosis transition can be predicted in a broader risk spectrum by sequentially integrating algorithms' and clinicians' risk estimates. For clinical translation, the proposed workflow should undergo large-scale international validation.  2021 American Medical Association.

We found that combined risk calculators outperformed all unimodal counterparts and clinical raters in terms of prognostic accuracy and cross-site stability. Importantly, our study revealed that the increased diagnostic burden arising from data fusion could be mitigated through optimized sequential testing that arranges clinicians and risk calculators into clinically scalable prognostic workflows. Based on this form of deferral learning,55 we showed that the complete assessment battery is only needed in 23.2% of the initial population (eFigure 15B in the Supplement). This subgroup was enriched for patients who received a prediction of psychosis transition in the initial clinical-neurocognitive examination, suggesting that biological markers of psychosis transition are useful for delineating true-positive from false-positive findings at the later steps of a multistep prognostic assessment.

Examining the baseline heterogeneity of our transdiagnostic population, we found functional-neurocognitive impairments in the ROD group akin to the CHR group and low between-group neuroanatomical and genetic separability (eTable 12 in the Supplement), supporting the neurobiological proximity between early-onset affective and psychotic disorders.26,30,56 Although CHR syndromes expectedly separated CHR and ROD groups at the cross-sectional level, we observed that these syndromes emerged in_19.2% of patients with ROD during the follow-up period, which led to psychosis transition in 1.8% of cases.56 Strikingly, our analyses also showed that the models’ prognostic accuracy, particularly the sensitivity for psychosis transition in patients with CHR, depended on patients with ROD being part of the model discovery process, which further supports the pooling of both groups into a broader risk population (eTable 14 and eFigure 12 in the Supplement). Our finding of a transdiagnostic predictability of psychosis was corroborated by the generalizability of the clinical-neurocognitive and neuroanatomical models to external samples, which showed markedly different risk levels, age distributions, and diagnostic compositions.

The in-depth analysis of the clinical-neurocognitive domain revealed that the presence of APSs facilitated a good baseline separability of CHR syndromes vs ROD and substantially informed the prediction of psychosis transition (eTable 13 in the Supplement). However, measures of childhood adversity,46 motor disturbances,57 and facial affect recognition58 did not overlap between diagnostic and prognostic models (eFigure 16 in the Supplement) and thus could be regarded as transdiagnostic markers59-62 of poor psychosis-related outcomes, including transition to psychosis. This interpretation was supported by the prognostic generalization of the clinical-neurocognitive model to the clinically relevant separation of patients with (1) nonremitting/de novo and nonsymptomatic CHR syndrome courses (eTable 15 in the Supplement) or (2) unfavorable perceptual, affective, functional, and basic symptom trajectories (eFigure 13 in the Supplement).63,64 Importantly, the model’s prognostic generalization capacity did not encompass nonpsychotic diagnoses (eTable 16 in the Supplement), and, thus, its prognostic pluripotency was confined to diverse CHR-specific symptom courses.65

Furthermore, we confirmed the prognostic value of PRS for schizophenia,48 as reported recently,16 and extended those findings by showing that genetic information augments the performance of clinical-neurocognitive models and prognostic workflows in a broader risk population (Table 2 and eTable 20 in the Supplement). Within this transdiagnostic setting, we replicated group-level differences among patients with psychosis transition, patients with nontransition, and healthy controls16 but also found that PRS-based prognostic assignments specifically differentiated APS-related trajectories (eFigure 13 in the Supplement).66 They also delineated patient groups with abnormally high and low genetic risk compared with healthy controls (eFigure 8 in the Supplement)—a finding that may point to distinct environmental and/or neurobiological pathways conferring risk and resilience to psychosis.67

The analysis of the structural neuroimaging data revealed a psychosis-predictive brain signature that generalized well across 3 independent cohorts. This signature overlapped with brain alterations previously reported to correlate with perceptual abnormalities, disorganization of speech and thought, and poor insight in early, subsyndromal, or prodromal stages of psychosis.9,68-70 Interestingly, nontransition-assigned patients showed reversed temporo-occipital volume reductions, which differentiated them from healthy controls (eFigure 9 in the Supplement). These findings may point to ongoing compensatory mechanisms of resilience to psychosis, as reported previously in a longitudinal sMRI study of adolescents with CHR.71 In this regard, our sMRI-based risk calculator may serve as a useful tool for enriching future observational studies and clinical trials with at-risk patients who express potential brain mechanisms of resilience to psychosis transition.

We observed that our raters matched unimodal risk calculators in predicting psychosis as measured by their BAC. However, raters also showed a pronounced optimism bias (low sensitivity and high specificity) toward the true risk of poor clinical outcome.13 It is noteworthy that their prognoses were based on all information collected in an extended study-related assessment and likely would be less accurate in routine, time-restricted diagnostic settings. Because the algorithmic counterparts showed exactly the inverted bias (high sensitivity and low specificity), the integration of clinicians and risk calculators into the cybernetic model produced a superior predictive system.50 Furthermore, our prognostic workflows demonstrated that similar levels of prognostic accuracy can be achieved by reducing the false-positive rate through sequential model application in patients with an estimated higher risk for psychosis transition (eFigure 14 in the Supplement). In this subgroup, the removal of the final sMRI-based assessment step increased false-positive findings (eFigure 15 in the Supplement), suggesting that the cost-benefit ratio of expensive neuromarkers needs to be individually adjusted according to the patient’s predicted risk.72

The finding that prognostic workflows always started with the clinical-neurocognitive model places the recognition of the clinical gestalt of emerging psychosis at the gateway of more precise early detection techniques.73 Our scalability experiments suggest that the laborious recognition of this pattern currently practiced in early recognition services could be effectively condensed to a few clinical-neurocognitive variables,6 thus enhancing the clinical utility of the proposed workflow. Nonetheless, future studies should revisit the validity of the selected 7 variables because they have been taken out of their original assessment context. Further studies also need to quantitatively explore the information patterns guiding clinicians’ gut-feeling estimates of psychosis transition and in turn foster more effective clinical early recognition strategies that integrate with cybernetic systems.
Limitations

Psychosis transitions were limited to 26 individuals in the PRONIA discovery sample. This sample size increased the risk of producing overly optimistic prediction results owing to an accidental collection of well-classifiable cases. We implemented a multistep model validation procedure to guard against this possibility, including label permutation testing, strict nested cross-validation of all processing steps,74 in-depth model analysis to assess possible prognostic confounds and moderators, specificity testing of all models in a completely held-back portion of the PRONIA sample, and model benchmarking in 3 independent data sets, which provided a further 45 individuals with psychosis transition and 600 with nontransition for external validation. Owing to limited data availability in these samples, only the condensed clinical-neurocognitive, sMRI-based, and a specific stacked risk calculator trained on the outputs of the former 2 models could be externally validated. However, our internal-external validation approach followed established guidelines for model construction and validation.21 In keeping with this literature, the similar performance levels observed in our LOSOCV and independent validation experiments support the validity of the models not tested in external samples."
Optimizing the predictive power of depression screenings using machine learning,"Objective: Mental health self-report and clinician-rating scales with diagnoses defined by sum-score cut-offs are often used for depression screening. This study investigates whether machine learning (ML) can detect major depressive episodes (MDE) based on screening scales with higher accuracy than best-practice clinical sum-score approaches. Methods: Primary data was obtained from two RCTs on the treatment of depression. Ground truth were DSM 5 MDE diagnoses based on structured clinical interviews (SCID) and PHQ-9 self-report, clinician-rated QIDS-16, and HAM-D-17 were predictors. ML models were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was compared against best-practice sum-score cut-offs. Primary outcome was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. DeLong's test with bootstrapping was used to test for differences in AUC. Secondary outcomes were balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and number needed to diagnose (NND). Results: A total of k = 1030 diagnoses (no diagnosis: k = 775; MDE: k = 255) were included. ML models achieved an AUCQIDS-16 = 0.94, AUCHAM-D-17 = 0.88, and AUCPHQ-9 = 0.83 in the testing set. ML AUC was significantly higher than sum-score cut-offs for QIDS-16 and PHQ-9 (ps ≤ 0.01; HAM_D-17: p = 0.847). Applying optimal prediction thresholds, QIDS-16 classifier achieved clinically relevant improvements (_balanced accuracy = 8%, _F1-score = 14%, _NND = 21%). Differences for PHQ_9 and HAM-D-17 were marginal. Conclusions: ML augmented depression screenings could potentially make a major contribution to improving MDE diagnosis depending on questionnaire (e.g., QIDS-16). Confirmatory studies are needed before ML enhanced screening can be implemented into routine care practice.  The Author(s) 2023.","The present study evaluated the potential of ML to enhance the performance of clinical assessment tools to detect MDE based on clinician-rated (QIDS-16, HAM-D-17) and self-report (PHQ-9) questionnaire data obtained in a pragmatic health care setting. The present results demonstrated that ML models like penalized logistic regression or naïve Bayes models can significantly increase the AUC of the ROC curve for the clinician-rated QIDS-16 (p_≤_0.001) and the self-report PHQ-9 (p_=_.009). However, while the difference for QIDS-16 and PHQ-9 were significant, especially the difference for the QIDS-16 indicates clinically relevant improvements (e.g. _balanced accuracy_=_8%, _F1-score_=_14%, _NND_=_21%) if the best class probability threshold is compared against current best practice clinical sum-score cut-offs. Underlining this finding, clinically relevant improvements were also observed for the QIDS-16 classifier in comparison to the best sample-specific cut-off (e.g. _balanced accuracy_=_5%, _F1-score_=_6%, _NND_=_13%). However, in contrast the differences in PHQ-9—although statistically significant—are below clinical relevance (_ROC AUC_=_1%, _balanced accuracy_=_0%, _F1-score_=_1%, _NND_=_1%), and for the HAM-D-17 we found no statistically difference in the ROC AUC, while seeing differences favoring ML, if the best class probability threshold for the ML classifier is compared to the clinical sum-score cut-off (_balanced accuracy_=_6%, _F1-score_=_12%, _NND_=_19%).

A key issue in the field limiting ML in achieving high accuracy and potentially explaining the differences in the findings across the here evaluated questionnaires, is the noise and measurement error of the underlying questionnaires and items (e.g. caused by social desirability bias, recall bias, systematic and random measurement error bias, or confirmation bias).57–59 In particular, patient reported outcome measures are prone to some biases (e.g. social desirability) compared to instruments rated by trained clinicians (e.g. QIDS-16), which may contribute to the difference of improvement by ML based on the QIDS-16 and PHQ-9. However, eliminating some sources of bias by a clinician rating does not guarantee a reliable assessment. For instance, the reliability of the HAM-D-17 has been shown to be questionable, in particular for some items.44,60,61 Contributing to this, the HAM-D-17 is characterized by less precise wording regarding the frequency and duration of symptoms when compared against other instruments like the PHQ-9 or QIDS-16 (e.g. HAM-D-17 mood refers to if feeling states of sadness are reported without categorization of frequency or duration, compared to PHQ-9 and QIDS-16 specified responses whether sadness occurs “at all”, “several times”, “more than half the times”, “nearly all the time”).9,42 In addition, core symptoms of depression according to the DSM-5 6 or ICD-11 62 (i.e. hypersomnia or hyperphagia) are missing in the HAM-D-17 potentially further explaining an increase in noise and measurement error compared to PHQ-9 and QIDS-16.4,9,42 Applying more precise and highly reliable assessments in clinical practice like computer-adaptive tests may provide an opportunity to increase measurement quality of questionnaires and thereby potential of ML in future.63–66

Furthermore, the present study could be expanded by including other data sources like electronic health records, molecular biosignatures (e.g. epigenomics), environmental data (e.g. lifestyle), physiological data, and smart-sensing and digital phenotyping data providing unbiased objective behavioral data using sensors in our daily life from omnipresent smart devices (e.g. in smartphones, smart watches and other wearables), might be promising to further augment ML algorithms in their predictive accuracy and maximize the potential of complex data and ML.34,67–75 However, this goes hand in hand with higher effort and costs to collect such data. In particular, the QIDS-16 might be suited to provide ML-optimized MDE predictions even without such an extension. That said, for health care providers (e.g. physicians), who have access to various sources of health records, the combination of different sources in an ML augmented expert system assisting them in the diagnosis of mental (and other) disorders could be feasible and promising. 75

In future, the application ML in the screening of depression and providing an instant prediction of the depression status based on the questionnaire data alone (e.g. based on QIDS-16)—or further augmented by objective sensing data, health records data, or biological parameters—may offer a way towards an accurate, time-efficient and thus feasible depression screening leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation in resource-limited mental health care.10,11,13,14 If proven to be effective, this could have a major impact on highly prevalent mental disorders like depression and public health.

However, some limitations of the present study must be considered and targeted in future studies before the implementation of ML-optimized depression screening in clinical settings. Most importantly, the present study is an exploratory secondary analysis. We used 10-fold cross-validation in the present study.76,77 Accordingly, the algorithms were trained on a subset of the data (exploratory) and the final performance of the trained models was evaluated on previously unknown data (confirmatory). While this procedure mirrors the logic of a confirmatory study to some extent, it cannot replace the necessity of confirmatory experimental studies eliminating other potential sources of bias and effects. Clinical randomized controlled trials (e.g. comparing ML-enhanced routine care screening of MDE against screening as usual) are of utmost importance before it comes to ML-augmented screening tools or expert systems in routine care settings. Also, it must be ensured that any ML-enhanced medical application derived is fair and unbiased.78–82 While the exploration of age and gender as additional features in the present analysis provided no meaningful improvements and is speaking for the generalizability, further evidence is needed that the benefit of ML in screening accuracy and performance holds across different gender, ages, ethnic and cultural populations. Speaking of generalizability, the setting of the included RCTs also needs to be considered. While the diagnoses and data of the present study were obtained in a pragmatic healthcare setting and the exploration of ML-enhanced screening procedures based on real-world healthcare data is a strong suit of this study, the healthcare setting at hand is also very specific: All participants were recruited in orthopedic rehabilitation centers.35–38 The replication of the present findings in different settings is highly needed. Nonetheless, by highlighting the potential of ML-enhanced screening tools for some questionnaires widely used in clinical practice (i.e. QIDS-16), the present study makes an important first step toward clinical trials and lays the foundation for future clinical implementation. Building on this, future studies could also move away from a binary classification (e.g. depression-free vs. MDE) towards a multi-classification approach to also support the differential diagnosis (e.g. distinguishing between various mental disorders with similar symptoms). However, it also needs to be highlighted, that the current nosology in clinical practice only insufficiently reflects the heterogeneous nature of mental disorder.83–85 For instance, over 1000 unique symptom profiles with a frequency of 1.8% of the most common profile have been reported in 3703 outpatients. 84 Furthermore, the poor reliability of diagnoses 86 and the high comorbidity as a potential indicator of unitary disorders being split up into various diagnoses 83 pose major limitations for research and practice. Investigating how ML can be applied in different systems (e.g. Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology 83 or the Extended Evolutionary Meta-Model87,88) to predict clinical relevant symptomology and inform treatment processes would be a very valuable addition to this study.

Conclusions
The present study evaluated the potential of ML to increase the performance of screening instruments for MDE. ML improved the performance of clinician-rated and self-report instruments (QIDS-16, PHQ-9). In particular, the optimization of the QIDS-16 indicated high clinical relevance. If proven to be effective in confirmatory studies, implementing ML-enhanced screening tools in clinical practice could significantly improve diagnostic procedures. Given that a timely and efficient diagnosis is key in healthcare, ML applications in mental health care may lay the foundation for optimized mental healthcare in future. However, further research how the potential of ML can be exploited (e.g. by including more data sources like socio-demographic, health records, biomarkers, and smart sensing data) and the implementation into routine care is highly needed."
Personalized symptom clusters that predict depression treatment outcomes: A replication of machine learning methods,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to use independent datasets to externally validate the three symptom clusters of unipolar depression identified by Chekroud, to evaluate personalized treatment trajectories and outcomes based on these symptom clusters, and to verify predictors. Methods: The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16)1 and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D)2 data from two placebo controlled, double-blind clinical trials (Dual Therapy and Duloxetine) were used for external validation. Machine learning methods were applied to replicate the three symptom clusters and to produce treatment trajectories. Penalized logistic regressions were conducted to identify top baseline variables that best predicted treatment outcomes. Results: The variables Chekroud identified as comprising sleep, atypical and core emotional clusters are replicated. Treatment trajectories demonstrate that dual treatment (escitalopram and bupropion) performed best across all symptom clusters but did not outperform escitalopram monotherapy over time. For each symptom cluster, there were differences in treatment efficacy among antidepressants. Conclusion: By using different treatment trajectories based on a patient's symptom cluster profile, clinicians could potentially select best fit antidepressants to achieve the biggest benefit. Our results showed that total baseline QIDS, Ham-D score, anxiety disorder diagnosis and course of depressive illness were the best baseline predictors. Results could enhance personalized depression treatment plans and help to improve outcomes. Clinical trials registration: NCT00519428, NCT00360724.  2023","Three symptom clusters of depression previously identified by Chekroud et al. (2016, 2017) were externally validated with two independent RCTs. The results were found to be both robust and consistent using clinician and patient-rated instruments. Based on baseline QIDS-SR or HAM-D scores, patients’ specific symptom cluster profiles can be easily determined by clinicians. Despite differences in the items used between QIDS-SR and Ham-D, three distinct clusters were found, with similar items. Our findings demonstrate that the clustering results are stable across studies and relatively insensitive to wording differences between the questionnaires and number of items per answer.

However, there were some differences between our results and those of Chekroud, et al. Two Ham-D items not included in the QIDS-SR checklist appeared in our clusters. Reduced libido was classified with the sleep cluster and somatic energy (fatigue) was classified in the core emotional cluster in the analyses from both clinical trials. When replicating findings of other investigators, it is reasonable to expect to find some differences, even just by chance. In their 2017 paper, Chekroud et al. were not able to consistently classify reduced libido and it was assigned to two different symptom clusters with different symptom check lists.

Another discrepancy was noted in the Duloxetine Study Ham-D data, where somatic anxiety was included in the atypical cluster, whereas in Chekroud et al. (2017), somatic anxiety was associated with the core emotional cluster. This might be caused by sample differences. The Dual Therapy Study (69.1%) and STAR*D (62.8%) included more women than men, while the Duloxetine Study sample was primarily male (56.9%). The mean score of somatic anxiety item is significantly higher for females in the Dual Therapy study (p = 0.008), but not in the Duloxetine study (p = 0.22). Women may experience more biologically based dysphoria and thus a sample containing more women may blur the boundaries between somatic anxiety and core emotional symptoms (Halbreich, 2007). Furthermore, the Duloxetine Study enrolled patients with persistent depressive disorder who were not in a current major depressive episode (Hellerstein et al., 2012), and their symptom profiles may differ from subjects in a chornic MDD episode. Depression severity differed between studies, in the Duloxetine Study, baseline Ham-D score was 14.5
 5, less severe than in the Dual Therapy Study, which had baseline Ham-D scores of 20
5 points.

The response trajectories according to each symptom cluster illustrate that treatment effects vary among antidepressants. The pharmacotherapies from both the Dual Therapy and Duloxetine trials indicate significant treatment effects for the core emotional symptom cluster, while treatment differences between the atypical and sleep symptom clusters were not statistically significant. Surprisingly, duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI16), which is reported to help with sleep symptoms (Brecht et al., 2008), did not perform better than placebo on the Sleep Symptom cluster, based on Ham-D items; the mean difference between baseline and week 10 was not significant. This finding suggests that treating sleep symptoms in addition to core emotional symptoms may lead to greater remission (Yuan, 2021) for patients with a sleep symptom cluster profile.

Symptom cluster-based response trajectories in our analysis also suggest that antidepressants work better for core emotional symptoms in general. Combined treatment of ESC+BUP performed better than monotherapy in treating atypical and core emotional symptoms. Finding remedies for sleep symptoms that work with SNRI antidepressants may significantly increase the remission rate for patients suffering from chronic depression or treatment resistant depression. Response trajectories to placebo showed initial beneficial effects on all symptom clusters for Duloxetine study. However, these effects were mostly lost by week10. This suggests that depressed patients with atypical and sleep dominant symptoms may show greater placebo effects than those who suffered more from core emotional symptoms.

The traditional definition used for MDD remission is a HAM-D summary score ≤ 7 (Zimmerman et al., 2006; Angst et al., 1996; Kelsey, 2001; Thase, 2003). Yet, a person in remission may still suffer somatic or sleep symptoms that can greatly affect his/her quality of life. Our findings suggest that instead of using total QIDS-SR or Ham-D scores, clinicians might focus more on symptom profiles specific to each patient. For instance, if findings are replicated, these results could reinforce the potential for clinicians to tailor treatment decisions based on clusters of treatments and set better expectations with patients about which kinds of symptoms are likely to improve significantly versus others that will see more modest benefit.

Symptom cluster-based predictive modeling successfully detected the top 10 predictors for each symptom cluster with great overlapping of variables. A total of 13 predictors across all three clusters suggest a more promising and feasible approach for predicting depression treatments. Three demographic variables, race, employment status and age; residence in Canada vs. United States; current comorbid anxiety, recurrent MDD, and course of MDD are the best baseline variables in predicting treatment outcomes. Having symptoms, such as psychomotor changes, suicidal ideation, loss of interest, middle insomnia, and poor self-outlook at baseline, can also significantly predict treatment outcomes. If replicated, these predictors could be easily collected in clinical settings and the baseline evaluation of a subject's dominant symptom cluster might help to facilitate clinicians’ prediction of treatment outcome and could potentially guide personalized depression treatment plans. The methods used in both cluster and predictive analyses can also be generalized to other domains and disorders.

The Duloxetine study was a small local study with only 34 patients in the medication treatment arm. Therefore, we did not use this dataset to externally validate the Chekroud findings. Multiple external validation studies across different geographic locations and study populations are needed to further examine the consistency of our model's predictive performance with these 13 predictors.

Our research has shown that advanced machine learning methods can use historical clinical trial datasets to build clinically meaningful and interpretable models, and thereby helping to optimize psychiatric care, bringing decision making to a patient level and thus enhancing the goals of precision medicine. Incorporation of biologic measures such as fNIRS (Li et al., 2022) into predictive models might result in more precise algorithms to guide precision treatment, thereby helping clinicians to translate such findings into use at the patient level.

4.1. Limitations
Discrepancies in predictive analyses between Chekroud et al. and our results may be primarily due to different baseline information collected. Study populations also differ. Duloxetine Study enrolled subjects with persistent depression who were not in a current major depressive episode. The Dual Therapy Study was a multi-nation, multi-sites study and we did observe a site effect for treatment outcome. There might be selection bias due to recruitment and clinical settings between Canada and the United States since patients at the US site were more chronic and severe (Stewart et al., 2014). Although Dual Therapy was a large RCT, it was not powered for the current analyses. Non-standardized evaluation forms and different definitions of outcomes and measurements may also create measurement bias in scoring the Ham-D and QIDS-SR (Tables 1a–Table 1b, Table 1cc)."
Predicting adherence to internet-Delivered psychotherapy for symptoms of depression and anxiety after myocardial infarction: Machine learning insights from the U-CARE heart randomized controlled trial,"Background: Low adherence to recommended treatments is a multifactorial problem for patients in rehabilitation after myocardial infarction (MI). In a nationwide trial of internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) for the high-risk subgroup of patients with MI also reporting symptoms of anxiety, depression, or both (MI-ANXDEP), adherence was low. Since low adherence to psychotherapy leads to a waste of therapeutic resources and risky treatment abortion in MI-ANXDEP patients, identifying early predictors for adherence is potentially valuable for effective targeted care. Objectives: The goal of the research was to use supervised Machine learning to investigate both established and novel predictors for iCBT adherence in MI-ANXDEP patients. Methods: Data were from 90 MI-ANXDEP patients recruited from 25 hospitals in Sweden and randomized to treatment in the iCBT trial Uppsala University Psychosocial Care Programme (U-CARE) Heart study. Time point of prediction was at completion of the first homework assignment. Adherence was defined as having completed more than 2 homework assignments within the 14-week treatment period. A supervised Machine learning procedure was applied to identify the most potent predictors for adherence available at the first treatment session from a range of demographic, clinical, psychometric, and linguistic predictors. The internal binary classifier was a random forest model within a 3_10–fold cross-validated recursive feature elimination (RFE) resampling which selected the final predictor subset that best differentiated adherers versus nonadherers. Results: Patient mean age was 58.4 years (SD 9.4), 62% (56/90) were men, and 48% (43/90) were adherent. Out of the 34 potential predictors for adherence, RFE selected an optimal subset of 56% (19/34; Accuracy 0.64, 95% CI 0.61-0.68, P<.001). The strongest predictors for adherence were, in order of importance, (1) self-assessed cardiac-related fear, (2) sex, and (3) the number of words the patient used to answer the first homework assignment. Conclusions: For developing and testing effective iCBT interventions, investigating factors that predict adherence is important. Adherence to iCBT for MI-ANXDEP patients in the U-CARE Heart trial was best predicted by cardiac-related fear and sex, consistent with previous research, but also by novel linguistic predictors from written patient behavior which conceivably indicate verbal ability or therapeutic alliance. Future research should investigate potential causal mechanisms and seek to determine what underlying constructs the linguistic predictors tap into. Whether these findings replicate for other interventions outside of Sweden, in larger samples, and for patients with other conditions who are offered iCBT should also be investigated.

Our study tested and compared established and novel predictors for adherence to 14 weeks of therapist-supported iCBT using data from 90 MI-ANXDEP patients recruited from 25 hospitals in Sweden and randomized to treatment in the U-CARE Heart clinical trial. The time point of prediction was after completion of the first homework assignment, which therefore allowed the study of previously untested linguistic predictors extracted from actual written behavior together with previously established predictors. A robust machine learning procedure sifted out the most potent predictors for adherence assessed at the end of treatment, which were found to be self-assessed cardiac fear, sex, number of words, self-assessed general cardiac anxiety, average sentence length, and number of mutual words used.

Clinical Interpretation and Possible Implications

Both symptoms of general cardiac anxiety and specific cardiac fear were among the strongest predictors, and to the extent of symptom and mechanistic overlap, this corroborates previous findings that depression is associated with increased adherence to cardiac rehabilitation [43]. It is even more likely that cardiac anxiety, which is directly linked to the present treatment, would trigger activity more strongly than depression, given the respective symptomatology. Depression and anxiety are highly interconnected, which might explain the result from the cited study. Thus, patients reporting high levels of depression and patients reporting high levels of anxiety have acknowledged that they have a problem. Overall, it seems reasonable given the strength of the anxiety-based predictors that those MI-ANXDEP patients who are relatively less worried, in general and specifically regarding their heart, are less likely to adhere to treatment that specifically targets such symptoms. Our study also found that female sex was an important predictor for adherence, in line with pooled iCBT trial data confirming that males have a higher drop-out rate from Web-based interventions for depression [20]. Although not interchangeable, drop out is reasonably related to poor adherence.

On the other hand, our findings do not replicate other previously identified predictors for adherence to iCBT such as education and age [12,20], possibly due to the relatively old MI-ANXDEP patient population or the differing recruitment procedure in this study relative to the bulk of previous iCBT studies. Neither was alcohol a predictor, which might be due to a generally low level of problem drinking in the study sample. Although the U-CARE Heart inclusion had relatively high ecological validity compared to other iCBT studies, our patients were still selected, excluding, for instance, those with suicidal tendencies. Moreover, the weak predictive power of depression as gauged by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), especially compared to symptoms of anxiety and their strong predictive power, is puzzling. This may be due to exclusion of severe depressive symptoms on the basis of suicide risk, whereas no such screening was applied for very high anxious symptomatology. With that said, HADS anxiety was not a useful predictor, possibly suggesting psychometric shortcomings of the particular HADS scale. Consequently, the more cardiospecific anxiety scale CAQ seems more relevant for adherence in MI-ANXDEP patients. Furthermore, alternative ongoing treatment external to the trial (eg, psychoactive medication and third-party counseling) was not predictive of adherence to iCBT. Important to note is that there were no restrictions on patients seeking additional external treatment available from the relatively well-developed Swedish health care system. This could perhaps explain the null finding through the principle of homeostasis applied to symptom severity and sought treatment. In a relatively free and rich society, particularly severe symptomatology should be compensated for by such patients seeking and receiving multimodal treatment as needed. If so, these factors might cancel each other out with respect to both the need for and adherence to iCBT.

We also discovered that novel linguistic predictors based on written verbal responses predicted adherence. The number of words may be a proxy for verbal fluency and degree of patient effort in therapy, and the number of mutual words might be a proxy for the degree of therapeutic alliance, which in part corroborates previous research on therapeutic alliance and other interlinked concepts that promote adherence to iCBT [12,19,20,24,43]. Together with previously known predictors, these linguistic predictors may enable improved risk stratification regarding which patients will likely adhere to treatment. This suggests a largely unexplored route for future clinical research seeking to lower iCBT treatment failure and might lead to further tailoring of limited therapeutic resources for augmenting cost-effectiveness and lowering human suffering in clinical care.

Although more work is arguably needed, the data collection, preprocessing, and analysis of written responses can be automated to a considerable degree so the current lack of off-the-shelf clinical utility might not be a future obstacle. An automated tool for predicting adherence can be constructed and then possibly used as a decision support tool by the clinician. Moreover, the tool could also determine the risk of low adherence in patients, which could possibly inform the tailoring of treatment for the MI-ANXDEP patient more objectivity and accurately compared to the guesswork and crude cutoffs often applied to counter low adherence in clinical research and care today. So-called artificial intelligence and the related supervised machine learning applications that are now being rapidly researched and implemented broadly would likely also be of benefit to better solve the clinically relevant problem of predicting adherence to internet-delivered treatments.

Limitations and Strengths

A limitation of this study is the sample size. Although the present U-CARE Heart study is the largest iCBT trial for MI-ANXDEP patients to date, it provides limited reliability estimates. The sample is too small to subdivide for more detailed analyses of those exclusively depressed or anxious. Within the limits of the present sample size not allowing for an external validation data set, the generalizability of findings is, however, quite good given that (a) applied predictive modeling procedure was robustly cross-validated, (b) national coverage was very good with recruitment from 25 hospitals, and (c) patients were recruited very similarly to routine clinical care.

Although we used expert content knowledge to select predictors and tested a range of common and domain specific predictors, there was still the possibility for using other predictors. This might explain the room for improvement in terms of classification acuity. Given that we studied a whole new class of predictors consisting of actual written behavior selected by domain experts, this study adds further novelty in that manner. The confirmation of some previously known predictors for adherence to psychotherapy with scarcely studied but very common MI-ANXDEP patients indicates potential clinical utility with MI-ANXDEP patients. The study was conducted in Sweden, and we cannot readily extrapolate our findings beyond our national and linguistic borders. The MI-ANXDEP population is also a distinct subgroup of MI patients, and the iCBT intervention is specifically tailored to these patients. Hence, replication outside of Sweden with different patients and for other psychotherapeutic treatments would be valuable.

There was also the limitation of operationalizing the outcome. This can be done in several ways, with the most strict adherence definition being to complete all treatment modules [44]. However, since the U-CARE Heart trial had particularly high ecological validity but suffered from generally low adherence [13], this cutoff definition of adherence automatically had to be low to be able to model adherence since the moderate sample size inhibited us from modeling unbalanced classes. Defining adherence as those patients continuing treatment beyond the first two standardized modules is also arguably more clinically relevant on qualitative grounds compared to an arbitrary percentage cutoff. Considering clinical needs and data availability, the patients were selected on completion of the initial standardized homework module—the optimal time to predict treatment adherence if one wants to also use linguistic predictors derived from written treatment response to make early in-treatment prediction of treatment adherence. There are also qualitative approaches to investigate adherence to iCBT [25] that might augment our understanding of adherence if combined with the current data-driven approach. Furthermore, the purpose of studying linguistic predictors automatically excluded 27 patients who were randomized to treatment but did not complete any homework assignment. For obvious reasons, our prediction model cannot generalize to these patients, yet it seems likely that prediction accuracy would theoretically be higher if including these patients because they constitute extreme cases of low adherence."
Predicting anxiety and depression in elderly patients using machine learning technology,"Anxiety and depression are two important mental health problems among the geriatric population. They are often undiagnosed and directly or indirectly responsible for various morbidities. Early and timely diagnosis has immense effect on appropriate management of anxiety and depression along with its co-morbidities. Owing to time constraint and enormous patient load, especially in developing county such as India it is hardly possible for a physician or surgeon to identify a geriatric patient suffering from anxiety and depression using any psychometric analysis tool. So, it is of utmost importance to develop a predictive model for automated diagnosis of anxiety and depression among them. This Letter aims to develop an appropriate predictive model, to diagnose anxiety and depression among older patient from socio-demographic and health-related factors, using machine learning technology. Ten classifiers were evaluated with a data set of 510 geriatric patients and tested with ten-fold cross-validation method. Highest prediction accuracy of 89% was obtained with random forest (RF) classifier. This RF model was tested with another data set from separate 110 older patients for its external validity. Its predictive accuracy was found to be 91% and false positive (FP) rate was 10%, compared with gold standard tool.  2017 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Researchers from both medical and engineering fields are trying to address this issue together. In this Letter, an endeavour has been made to predict one of the most important age-related mental changes, i.e. anxiety and depression among the older people, from socio-demographic and medical factors, using machine learning technology. A considerably large number (510) of elderly patients were interviewed and screened for anxiety and depression. This data set was used for predictive modelling. Study conducted by Suhasini et al. [37] tried to predict mental health problems of 400 psychiatric patients, not exclusively on older patients, using machine learning technology. However, this kind of study specially focusing on elderly patient is hardly available in literature. Study conducted by Bhakta and Sau [38] on prediction of depression among elderlies living in a slum at Kolkata found that among four different classifiers (BN, logistic, MLP, and SMO) BN and SMO algorithms predicted depression with an accuracy of almost 90%. In this Letter, at first relevant features were selected using attribute evaluator in WEKA. Ten features were found to be effective. Then, ten machine learning classifiers were evaluated and RF had the highest predictive accuracy with ten-fold cross-validation test. This RF model was tested on another 110 elderly patients for its external validity. Its predictive accuracy was found to be 91% and FP rate was only 10%, compared with gold standard HADS. This Letter will pave the way for future research work in search for better classifier with appropriate features especially suitable for the geriatric patients. Moreover, this can be extended to identify older persons suffering from underlying mental health problems, from general population at community level."
Predicting Depression among Patients with Diabetes Using Longitudinal Data. A Multilevel Regression Model," Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on “Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare”.

Background: Depression is a common and often undiagnosed condition for patients with diabetes. It is also a condition that significantly impacts healthcare outcomes, use, and cost as well as elevating suicide risk. Therefore, a model to predict depression among diabetes patients is a promising and valuable tool for providers to proactively assess depressive symptoms and identify those with depression.

Objectives: This study seeks to develop a generalized multilevel regression model, using a longitudinal data set from a recent large-scale clinical trial, to predict depression severity and presence of major depression among patients with diabetes.

Methods: Severity of depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 score. Predictors were selected from 29 candidate factors to develop a 2-level Poisson regression model that can make population-average predictions for all patients and subject-specific predictions for individual patients with historical records. Newly obtained patient records can be incorporated with historical records to update the prediction model. Root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were used to evaluate predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores. The study also evaluated the classification ability of using the predicted PHQ-9 scores to classify patients as having major depression.

Results: Two time-invariant and 10 time-varying predictors were selected for the model. Incorporating historical records and using them to update the model may improve both predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores and classification ability of the predicted scores. Subject-specific predictions (for individual patients with historical records) achieved RMSE about 4 and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve about 0.9 and are better than population-average predictions.

Conclusions: The study developed a generalized multilevel regression model to predict depression and demonstrated that using generalized multilevel regression based on longitudinal patient records can achieve high predictive ability.","This study developed a 2-level Poisson re-
gression model from the DCAT clinical
trial to predict PHQ-9 scores for patients
with diabetes using two time-invariant and
10 time-varying predictors related to
demographics, diabetes, health conditions,
and healthcare utilizations. The predicted
PHQ-9 scores can be used for assessing de-
pression severity and classifying patients as
having major depression.
Estimated fixed effects (_ Table 3) can
be used to make population-average pre-
dictions for individuals out of the DCAT
dataset. To make subject-specific predic-
tions for individuals out of the DCAT data-
set, users would need a group of patients
with multiple historical records that con-
tain PHQ-9 scores and the 12 predictors to
train an initial model. With those data, the
model could then be used to make subject-
specific predictions for patients in the
group. Similar to the validation process de-
scribed above, newly generated records
could be incorporated to update the model.
An important implication of the study
results is that incorporating historical rec-
ords and using them to update the model
may improve both the accuracy of predict-
ing PHQ-9 scores and the ability to classify
patients with major depression. The sub-
ject-specific predictions can achieve very
good to excellent classification of major de-
pression, as demonstrated by the 0.88–0.91
areas under ROC curve. These values are
significantly better than the 0.72–0.80 areas
under ROC curve achieved in prior de-
pression prediction studies [12–15].
Besides multilevel regression, another
applicable longitudinal modeling method
is generalized estimating equation (GEE).
The main difference between using multi-
level regression and using GEE for predic-
tion is that GEE can only derive popu-
lation-average prediction [24]. Application
of GEE with the same 12 predictors to the
dataset used in this study leads to better
predictions than the population-average
predictions of generalized multilevel re-
gression, but the predictive ability of GEE
for the three follow-ups is worse than the
subject-specific predictions of generalized
multilevel regression (GEE: RMSE for
baseline = 5.26, for 6-month = 4.46, for
12-month = 4.27, for 18-month = 4.54; area
under ROC curve for baseline = 0.73, for
6-month = 0.87, for 12-month = 0.84, for
18-month = 0.86). More discussions about
GEE and its comparison to multilevel re-
gression can be found elsewhere in the
literature [24, 30, 31]. The study has several limitations and
opportunities for future research. First, al-
though our results suggest that incorporat-
ing historical records can improve predic-
tive ability, the finding is not conclusive be-
cause the DCAT dataset includes only four
waves of data in 6-month intervals. Future
research is indicated to further investigate
the influences of using historical records
for prediction. Second, some predictors
used in the model, such as diabetes emo-
tional burden and diabetes regimen dis-
tress [32], are not typically available in cur-
rent medical practices, which may limit the
applicability of the model. Third, the
number of candidate predictors in the
study is limited, which calls for future re-
search to investigate a broader range of
predictors. Fourth, predictor selection in
the study is based on p-values obtained
from conditional t-tests, which are some-
times not reliable [27, 33]. Future research
is needed to address this issue. Finally,
study patients are predominantly Hispanics
from safety-net clinics in Los Angeles area,
which may limit the generalizability of the
model and calls for future research on a
broader population."
"Predicting depression from smartphone behavioral markers using machine learning methods, hyperparameter optimization, and feature importance analysis: Exploratory study","Background: Depression is a prevalent mental health challenge. Current depression assessment methods using self-reported and clinician-administered questionnaires have limitations. Instrumenting smartphones to passively and continuously collect moment-by-moment data sets to quantify human behaviors has the potential to augment current depression assessment methods for early diagnosis, scalable, and longitudinal monitoring of depression. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of predicting depression with human behaviors quantified from smartphone data sets, and to identify behaviors that can influence depression. Methods: Smartphone data sets and self-reported 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression assessments were collected from 629 participants in an exploratory longitudinal study over an average of 22.1 days (SD 17.90; range 8-86). We quantified 22 regularity, entropy, and SD behavioral markers from the smartphone data. We explored the relationship between the behavioral features and depression using correlation and bivariate linear mixed models (LMMs). We leveraged 5 supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms with hyperparameter optimization, nested cross-validation, and imbalanced data handling to predict depression. Finally, with the permutation importance method, we identified influential behavioral markers in predicting depression. Results: Of the 629 participants from at least 56 countries, 69 (10.97%) were females, 546 (86.8%) were males, and 14 (2.2%) were nonbinary. Participants’ age distribution is as follows: 73/629 (11.6%) were aged between 18 and 24, 204/629 (32.4%) were aged between 25 and 34, 156/629 (24.8%) were aged between 35 and 44, 166/629 (26.4%) were aged between 45 and 64, and 30/629 (4.8%) were aged 65 years and over. Of the 1374 PHQ-8 assessments, 1143 (83.19%) responses were nondepressed scores (PHQ-8 score <10), while 231 (16.81%) were depressed scores (PHQ-8 score ≥10), as identified based on PHQ-8 cut-off. A significant positive Pearson correlation was found between screen status–normalized entropy and depression (r=0.14, P<.001). LMM demonstrates an intraclass correlation of 0.7584 and a significant positive association between screen status–normalized entropy and depression (_=.48, P=.03). The best ML algorithms achieved the following metrics: precision, 85.55%-92.51%; recall, 92.19%-95.56%; F1, 88.73%-94.00%; area under the curve receiver operating characteristic, 94.69%-99.06%; Cohen _, 86.61%-92.90%; and accuracy, 96.44%-98.14%. Including age group and gender as predictors improved the ML performances. Screen and internet connectivity features were the most influential in predicting depression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that behavioral markers indicative of depression can be unobtrusively identified from smartphone sensors’ data. Traditional assessment of depression can be augmented with behavioral markers from smartphones for depression diagnosis and monitoring.

Our objective was to investigate the feasibility of predicting depression using multivariate digital biomarkers quantified from smartphone data sets collected in a real-world study. In this study, we used 13,898 days of smartphone data set, and 1374 PHQ-8 depression assessments from 629 participants to explore the feasibility of detecting depression from participants’ behavioral markers (ie, digital biomarkers) quantified from their smartphones. We focused on finding the relationship between repeated measures of depression scores and participant’s digital biomarkers and developing predictive models to classify depressed and nondepressed symptom severity scores.
Principal Results

This data set was collected from a heterogeneous geographic (ie, from at least 56 different countries), occupational, and educational population, with high interindividual differences (ie, 75.84% interclass correlation).

Despite this heterogeneity, digital biomarkers extracted from participants’ smartphone data set were able to predict participants’ depression state (ie, depressed or nondepressed) with high predictive performance using ML models. The ML models achieved the following: precision, 85.55%-92.51%; recall, 92.19%-95.56%; F1, 88.73%-94.00%; AUC, 94.69%-99.06%; Cohen _, 86.61%-92.90%; and accuracy, 96.44%-98.14%. These findings show that predictive modeling of mental health using digital biomarkers is not only possible in small homogenous populations [83,84], but also in a more general population, which further supports the scalability of this approach and its potential positive impact on health care if implemented (eg, early detection of mental disorders, RED-flag systems after treatment).

Moreover, we found that the predictive performances of ML classifiers improved when demographic characteristics were included among predictors, indicating that such variables should also be included in clinical applications. Previous studies suggest a relationship between demographic factors, smartphone usage behavior, and depression [38,85,86]. Thus, encoded in the demographic data of this study’s population is additional information that is useful in predicting the depression state of the participants. Therefore, the inclusion of additional data from clinical information systems (eg, blood parameters, previous clinical diagnosis) might be a valuable way to further increase the performance of prediction models.

Interestingly, tree-based, nearest neighbor–based classifiers had superior performance over linear classifiers, including SVM with RBF kernel, corroborating the existence of nonlinear relationships between digital biomarkers and depression. This finding further supported the correlation finding, which failed to replicate previous results reported in Saeb et al [33]. We could only identify that participants with depression symptoms were more likely to lock and unlock their phone’s screen in a random and uncertain manner (ie, significant positive correlation between screen status–normalized entropy and depression, r=0.14, P<.001). The screen status–normalized entropy biomarker quantified the frequency and distribution (ie, complexity and uncertainty) in the transition of the participants’ phone screen on and off states. All other indicators were nonsignificant. Moreover, correlation coefficients only measure the extent of the linear relationship between variables [87,88]. Instead of correlations, previous studies on mental health relied on the mutual information (MI) method from Information theory [87-89]. The advantage of using the MI method is that the MI measures both linear and nonlinear statistical dependencies between variables.

Given the high ICC, we tested whether LMM, a much robust method for finding linear relationships, can identify additional linear relationships. However, the results from the association analyses further showed that a unit increase in the screen status–normalized entropy positively increases the average depression score (_=.48, P=.03), but all other variables remained nonsignificant. This suggests that conventional statistical methods (eg, correlation or LMM) may not depict the complex nonlinear relationship between digital biomarkers and depression, and indeed more powerful methods such as ML models (eg, XGB) are needed to make better predictions [90].

The heterogeneity and inconsistency in correlation findings (ie, linear relationships) in the field are common issues [26]. Until now, it is unclear whether this is due to differences in sociodemographic characteristics in samples, in used sensors, in the method to calculate features, small sample sizes and lack of power, or even due to other between-study factors. Meta-analysis on digital markers and health outcomes (eg, depression) would be highly valuable to clearly show whether and to which extent linear relationships exist. Using meta-regression, the factors causing the differences in correlation findings may also be identified.

Nevertheless, both the correlation findings and the feature importance analysis in the prediction models clearly showed that participants’ phone screen (lock and unlock) behaviors, such as routinely and randomly locking and unlocking phone screen, and internet connectivity behaviors played the most important role in predicting their depression state. The findings in this study are also supported by prior research that investigated the relationship between screen interactions and mental health [3,27,28,33]. Passively sensed participants’ smartphone screen interaction (ie, on and off states) behavior was demonstrated to be an important predictor of mental health [27]. Similar findings have been reported previously [3,33], where the number of times a participant interacts with their phone, including screen lock and unlocks, was found to correlate with participants’ mental health state. In a neuroscience study [91], screen unlocks were found to be important behavioral markers that correlate and predict resting state brain functional connectivity, which is known to be associated with depression [92]. On internet usage behaviors, research has demonstrated an association between internet usage patterns and depression [93,94], which was also a key feature in our analysis. Thus, including these features in future studies is highly recommended.
Limitations and Future work

Given the crowdsourced nature of the deployment of the Carat app, the sample size in the data set is small (N=629) and may not be representative of the general population. Despite the data set having a fair distribution of age groups, with a spread over several countries, it is biased toward highly educated and professional occupations. The data set is also biased toward males in gender distribution. Future research with a larger sample size and a balanced gender distribution could explore correlations, associations, and prediction performance for population subgroups.

Clinical diagnosis of depression was not an inclusion criterion for our sample population. The data set also does not contain a clinical or self-reported baseline assessment of depression and has scarce high depression scores. Because of the crowdsourced rolling recruitment nature of participants, the data set contained an unequal number of repeated depression assessments for all participants. Future research should benefit from replicating the experiment in a clinical population and a more controlled experimental design. With a clinical baseline data set, future research could study the differences in features between depressed and nondepressed groups.

The correlation and association between behavioral patterns extracted from the data set in this study and depression do not necessarily imply causal relationships. For example, the correlation between screen status–normalized entropy and depression may be caused by other confounding variables. In addition, the correlation and association between screen status–normalized entropy and depression are not strong and may not generalize in other populations. Further research is needed to establish the extent to which such behaviors cause or are a consequence of depression.

Lastly, the data set was collected from Android participants only, and the long-term use of the Carat app could influence participants’ behavior [38,39]. Research has shown that participant’s behavior and sociodemographics may differ between Android platforms and other mobile platforms such as iOS [44,95]. Future research could replicate this study to explore the extent of the differences in the participants’ behaviors (ie, digital biomarkers of participants using Android, iOS, and other mobile platforms).

Replicating the findings from this study with additional biomarkers from GPS and wearable sensor data sets and comparing their correlation and biomarker predictive importance will be interesting in future work. There would be a major design implication for depression intervention development if the behavioral markers from screen and internet connectivity achieve similar promising results as biomarkers from GPS and wearable devices. We hypothesize that screen interaction and internet connectivity data sets alone are less privacy intrusive, could better capture behaviors of immobile persons, and people may be more willing to donate such data sets to science. For example, Apple’s Screen Time and Google’s Digital Wellbeing app are processing and presenting such data to users to inform where and how users spent their time on smartphones."
Predicting Depression in Adolescents Using Mobile and Wearable Sensors: Multimodal Machine Learning–Based Exploratory Study,"Background: Depression levels in adolescents have trended upward over the past several years. According to a 2020 survey by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 4.1 million US adolescents have experienced at least one major depressive episode. This number constitutes approximately 16% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. However, only 32.3% of adolescents received some form of specialized or nonspecialized treatment. Identifying worsening symptoms earlier using mobile and wearable sensors may lead to earlier intervention. Most studies on predicting depression using sensor-based data are geared toward the adult population. Very few studies look into predicting depression in adolescents. Objective: The aim of our work was to study passively sensed data from adolescents with depression and investigate the predictive capabilities of 2 machine learning approaches to predict depression scores and change in depression levels in adolescents. This work also provided an in-depth analysis of sensor features that serve as key indicators of change in depressive symptoms and the effect of variation of data samples on model accuracy levels. Methods: This study included 55 adolescents with symptoms of depression aged 12 to 17 years. Each participant was passively monitored through smartphone sensors and Fitbit wearable devices for 24 weeks. Passive sensors collected call, conversation, location, and heart rate information daily. Following data preprocessing, 67% (37/55) of the participants in the aggregated data set were analyzed. Weekly Patient Health Questionnaire-9 surveys answered by participants served as the ground truth. We applied regression-based approaches to predict the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score and change in depression severity. These approaches were consolidated using universal and personalized modeling strategies. The universal strategies consisted of Leave One Participant Out and Leave Week X Out. The personalized strategy models were based on Accumulated Weeks and Leave One Week One User Instance Out. Linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms were trained to model the data. Results: We observed that personalized approaches performed better on adolescent depression prediction compared with universal approaches. The best models were able to predict depression score and weekly change in depression level with root mean squared errors of 2.83 and 3.21, respectively, following the Accumulated Weeks personalized modeling strategy. Our feature importance investigation showed that the contribution of screen-, call-, and location-based features influenced optimal models and were predictive of adolescent depression. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the feasibility of using passively sensed data for predicting adolescent depression. We demonstrated prediction capabilities in terms of depression score and change in depression level. The prediction results revealed that personalized models performed better on adolescents than universal approaches. Feature importance provided a better understanding of depression and sensor data. Our findings can help in the development of advanced adolescent depression predictions. Tahsin Mullick, Ana Radovic, Sam Shaaban, Afsaneh Doryab.","This study presented an in-depth analysis of passively sensed multimodal data collected over a period of 24 weeks from 37 adolescents to predict depression. The collection of data coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak and allowed for the observation of sensor data predictive capability in this scenario. Our models predicted both depression scores and change in the level of depression over weeks. The results showed reasonable improvements compared with the baseline models for both depression score and change in depression level prediction.We explored universal and personalized modeling strategies. Overall, given the unpredictability of mental health patterns in individuals, personalized models were the most optimal. The Accumulate Weeks modeling approach, which relied on previous windows of sensor observations, achieved an RMSE of 2.83 for depression score predictions and an RMSE of 3.21 for change in depression score prediction. This provides a strong intuition regarding the model’s performance. In cases of depression prediction, the model can differ by a score of approximately 2 and, for change in depression score, by a score of approximately 3. This realization of the results points toward the future research and development of more sophisticated personalized predictive modeling to map individual behavioral traits between participants."
Predicting depression in community dwellers using a machine learning algorithm,"Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Given the socioeconomic burden of depression, appropriate depression screening for community dwellers is necessary. We used data from the 2014 and 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The 2014 dataset was used as a training set, whereas the 2016 dataset was used as the hold-out test set. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to control for class imbalances between the depression and non-depression groups in the 2014 dataset. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for feature reduction and classifiers in the final model. Data obtained from 9488 participants were used for the machine learning process. The depression group had poorer socioeconomic, health, functional, and biological measures than the non-depression group. From the initial 37 variables, 13 were selected using LASSO. All performance measures were calculated based on the raw 2016 dataset without the SMOTE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and overall accuracy in the hold-out test set were 0.903 and 0.828, respectively. Perceived stress had the strongest influence on the classifying model for depression. LASSO can be practically applied for depression screening of community dwellers with a few variables. Future studies are needed to develop a more efficient and accurate classification model for depression.  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","We built a machine learning-based model for predicting future depression. The AUC (0.903), overall accuracy (0.828), sensitivity (0.828), and specificity (0.828) showed that this model could be practically used for screening community-dwelling individuals who may develop depression.
In the final set of variables, perceived stress was the strongest predictor of depression. Stress is generally categorized as either eustress or distress. Eustress represents positive aspects of stress, whereas distress refers to its negative aspects. Perceived stress measures distress by using questions such as “In the last month, how often have you felt nervous and stressed?” The negative effects of stress have a well-documented relationship with the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, such as depression [32,33]. As most screening instruments for depression do not contain the term “stress,” perceived stress should be included in screenings of community-dwelling individuals. Moreover, subjective health was ranked as the second most predictive variable for classifying depression. The concept of subjective health reflects the quality of life or well-being [34,35]. Subjective health plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression [36]. Although depression might contribute to perceived stress and poor subjective health, these factors should be considered important for the early detection of depression.
Our study had several strengths. First, we built a model to classify depression among community dwellers. Although depression causes substantial disability, the treatment of clinical depression is difficult [13]. Hence, early screening and detection of depression among community dwellers are particularly important, and many countries have focused on screening for depression in community settings before the clinical stages of the disease [37,38]. Thus, we believe our model could be practically used in community mental health institutions for accurate and prompt screening of depression.
Second, we used various types of variables. As depression is based on a complex interaction among biopsychosocial variables [39,40,41], clinicians must utilize the possible correlates of depression to improve classification. We included peripheral biomarkers (e.g., thyroid hormone, hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase), psychosocial functioning (e.g., EQ-5D), and sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, sex, marital status, educational level, and economic status) to classify depression.
Third, we used LASSO to reduce features and build a final model to classify depression. We found that a model with fewer variables resulted in a performance comparable to one with more variables. We believe that practicality is necessary for such a machine learning model, and from a practical perspective, a questionnaire with too many questions might not be suitable for use in routine screening settings. If the performance between the two models is not substantially different, one with fewer variables could be practically used with the benefits of a short screening time and effort. As we developed this model for use in community health institutions, rather than higher-level facilities, we presumed that low computing costs with fewer variables are an important point. The reasonable computing costs of LASSO facilitate its deployment in community health institutions.
Fourth, it is noteworthy to discuss why we used the 2014 dataset for the training set and the 2016 dataset for the test set, rather than randomly selecting training and test sets. First, we wanted to test whether the algorithm made with past data (i.e., the 2014 dataset) could be applied to future data (i.e., the 2016 dataset). There will be some changes in the frequency or severity of the variables by reflecting the number of times the dataset was collected. If an algorithm should be useful in the real world over time, it should be robust for future data. In addition, there were statistical differences in many of the variables between the 2014 and 2016 datasets, whereas there was no statistical difference in the severity of depression between the two datasets. We interpreted the results mainly in terms of sample size and standard deviation. Generally, as the total sample size increases, the p-value decreases [42]. As the sample size was large (n = 9488), negligible differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover, as the standard deviation (i.e., the degree of spread) increases, the p-value increases [43]; thus, the non-significant statistical difference in the severity of depression (i.e., PHQ score) resulted from a high standard deviation. As the participants of this study were from the general population, the distribution of the PHQ score would be severely positively skewed, which is associated with a high standard deviation.
This study had several limitations. First, although we included biopsychosocial factors for depression, neuroimaging and genetic variables were not available. Neuroimaging markers, such as structural volumes and functional activity, have long been used to classify depression [44,45]. Genetic studies have also provided information for understanding and classifying depression [4]. As this study sought to create a prompt and accurate tool to classify depression, such expensive tests do not seem applicable for a screening test. Nonetheless, we should consider whether biological factors are, indeed, helpful for discriminating depression. For example, a previous study revealed that the singular use of biomarkers to predict depression prognosis resulted in a poor performance (AUC < 0.6) [46]. The small effects of biological factors were confirmed in our study; only blood urea nitrogen was included in the final model throughout LASSO. Second, due to the limited sample size, we could not subdivide the study population by age group (e.g., youth, middle-aged adults, and older adults); instead, we grouped all ages to build a machine learning model. Given the different contributors to depression across different age groups [47,48], future studies with larger sample sizes are needed. Third, the survey data may not sufficiently reflect respondents’ interpersonal relationships. For example, a recent study revealed that Facebook entries predicted future clinical depression [49]. Although the sample size was small (n = 683), and the outcome measure was only moderately predictive (AUC = 0.69 to 0.72), such an approach should be used to supplement future surveys and help construct a more comprehensive dataset.
In summary, we successfully built a model for classifying depression using the LASSO algorithm and sociodemographic, psychosocial, and laboratory data obtained from community dwellers. We believe that this model may help improve the accuracy of depression screening among community-dwelling individuals."
Predicting Depression in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis Using Machine Learning: Model Development and Validation Study,"Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of OA and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Chronic pain and functional loss secondary to knee OA put patients at risk of developing depression, which can also impair their treatment response. However, no tools exist to assist clinicians in identifying patients at risk. Machine learning (ML) predictive models may offer a solution. We investigated whether ML models could predict the development of depression in patients with knee OA and examined which features are the most predictive. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to develop and test an ML model to predict depression in patients with knee OA at 2 years and to validate the models using an external data set. The secondary aim was to identify the most important predictive features used by the ML algorithms. Methods: Osteoarthritis Initiative Study (OAI) data were used for model development and external validation was performed using Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) data. Forty-two features were selected, which denoted routinely collected demographic and clinical data such as patient demographics, past medical history, knee OA history, baseline examination findings, and patient-reported outcome measures. Six different ML classification models were trained (logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], ridge regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting machine). The primary outcome was to predict depression at 2 years following study enrollment. The presence of depression was defined using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and F1 score. The most important features were extracted from the best-performing model on external validation. Results: A total of 5947 patients were included in this study, with 2969 in the training set, 742 in the test set, and 2236 in the external validation set. For the test set, the AUC ranged from 0.673 (95% CI 0.604-0.742) to 0.869 (95% CI 0.824-0.913), with an F1 score of 0.435 to 0.490. On external validation, the AUC varied from 0.720 (95% CI 0.685-0.755) to 0.876 (95% CI 0.853-0.899), with an F1 score of 0.456 to 0.563. LASSO modeling offered the highest predictive performance. Blood pressure, baseline depression score, knee pain and stiffness, and quality of life were the most predictive features. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply ML classification models to predict depression in patients with knee OA. Our study showed that ML models can deliver a clinically acceptable level of performance (AUC>0.7) in predicting the development of depression using routinely available demographic and clinical data. Further work is required to address the class imbalance in the training data and to evaluate the clinical utility of the models in facilitating early intervention and improved outcomes. Zuzanna Nowinka, M Abdulhadi Alagha, Khadija Mahmoud, Gareth G Jones.","The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible, with high accuracy, to predict depression in patients with knee OA using a variety of routinely collected data such as patient demographics, medical history, examination findings, and patient-reported outcome measures. The developed ML models achieved clinically relevant discrimination between depressed and nondepressed patients, with LASSO identified as the best-performing model, yielding an AUC of 0.876 (95% CI 0.853-0.899) on external validation. The accuracies for external validation were high, ranging from 0.865 (GBM) to 0.895 (ridge), meaning that between 86.5% and 89.5% of all patients were correctly classified. However, the F1 scores ranged from 0.456 (ridge) to 0.563 (LASSO). Low F1 scores despite high accuracy implies that the models can identify patients without depression more accurately than those with depression. This is likely due to class imbalance in the data set, which is a common problem in medical research that results in predictive modeling bias toward the majority [47].

While ML may provide a valuable predictive tool, the clinical implementation often raises concerns due to model complexity, often referred to as the “black-box” problem [46]. One way of improving model understanding is to extract the most important features [48]. In this study, blood pressure, the baseline CES-D, the total WOMAC, as well as mental and physical components for SF-12 were identified as being the most informative measures for prediction. Although this does not imply a statistically significant correlation between the features and the prediction outcome, it is reassuring that the input features identified by LASSO have previously been highlighted as factors associated with an increased risk of developing depression in patients with OA [8,9,49]. Surprisingly, blood pressure was identified as being the most informative factor for prediction. The presence of multiple comorbidities can further increase the risk of depression development in patients with knee OA, regardless of their pathophysiology [49]. Notably, the radiographic severity of OA was not highlighted as a predictive feature for depression development. This is consistent with previous research showing that depression and pain are independent from the extent of radiographic degenerative changes [50]. This known discrepancy between knee OA symptoms and radiographic severity highlights the complex nature of the disease and the need for more objective assessment tools. The association between depression, chronic conditions, and pain is complex. The temporality of the relationship between depression and pain has been poorly researched, but it appears that both factors potentiate each other, with higher pain severity increasing the persistence of depressed mood and the presence of pain increasing the incidence of depression [5,7,28,51,52]. This highlights the essential role of appropriate, interdisciplinary mental health support for patients with knee OA.

ML predictive models have an important role in augmenting clinical judgment, and when compared with standard predictions, they produce more accurate and less variable risk estimates [53]. The best-performing model in our study, LASSO, could be potentially used to aid in identification of patients at risk of future depression. Since the CES-D score has been designed as a screening tool, the patients identified as “positive” by our model would have to undergo further, more specialist mental health assessment. Depending on that outcome, the patients could be offered either a self-help aid, or potentially, a specialist referral. This would be more economical and time-efficient than assessing every patient attending with knee pain. However, further research is required since the implementation of predictive models is often difficult due to lack of clear clinical guidance on how to act upon the predicted outcome [54].

The advantage of our models lies in their simplicity as they rely on easily accessible clinical information. In addition, LASSO identified only 6 features to be crucial for prediction, making the model more practical. Blood pressure is routinely measured by primary health care practitioners, and WOMAC, SF-12, and CES-D scores are commonly used patient-reported outcome measures [55-57]. The aforementioned questionnaires are brief and require minimal training. Currently, there is no proven strategy to prevent or cure knee OA, and the therapy is focused on alleviating pain and addressing functional limitations [9]. Since depression is a potentially modifiable risk factor for worsening pain and function in knee OA, our prediction model could offer a targeted, preventative strategy. Diagnosing depression in patients with concurrent chronic pain conditions is challenging and having such information would facilitate discussions around the patient’s mental health, even at times when the patient is not yet aware of their symptoms. While further research is required to evaluate the practical aspects of the clinical application, the findings of our study represent an important step toward developing a potential diagnostic aid, addressing a significant gap in knee OA care.

Comparison With Prior Work
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying ML to predict depression in patients with knee OA. One previous study attempted to develop a prediction model based on logistic regression using conventional statistical methods [22]. Although the model achieved a clinically acceptable performance with an AUC of 0.742 (_95% CI 0.622-0.862), it was built using a small sample of patients and was not tested on an independent sample or externally validated [22].

Diagnosis of depression is challenging in clinical practice, and ML models have been previously applied to predict illness in different patient populations [58-62]. Clinically relevant predictive performance of common ML classification algorithms was shown in two studies predicting postpartum depression [58,59]. Cvetkovic [60] used a deep-learning approach to predict depression in breast cancer patients, achieving high internal accuracy. However, the study methodology was poorly reported, with information lacking on data preprocessing and model testing [60]. In another study, depression and anxiety in college students were estimated using GBM, with satisfactory performance yielding an AUC of 0.730 [61]. When applied to community-residing older adults, a logistic regression model achieved variable accuracy, ranging from 58.33% for severe depression to 90.44% for mild depression [62]. The variation in model performance achieved by these studies could be attributed to the use of different algorithms, different evaluation tools for detection of depressive symptoms, as well as the use of different predictive features.

Strengths
Our study is strengthened by the use of a large patient cohort for model development, testing, and validation. The list of input features was carefully curated, with selection based on literature evidence, domain expertise, and data completeness. In addition, our predictive models were externally validated and performed well in an independent cohort, demonstrating their generalizability and potential for clinical application. Notably, LASSO identified only six features to be crucial for prediction, which showcases the simplicity of our method and the ease with which this tool could be used in a clinical setting.

Limitations
Several limitations should be addressed in future research. First, the study sample used for model development might not be representative of a general population of patients with knee OA. The prevalence of depressed patients in the training set was 9.2%, which is much lower than the 20% rate previously suggested by the literature [63]. The OAI study excluded patients with end-stage OA, morbid obesity, or those with terminal diseases, whereas these factors are associated with an even higher risk of depression [25,49]. Second, both the OAI and the MOST data sets were based in the United States with patients from a predominantly white ethnic background [25,26]. Further validation of our prediction model in a more ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population would help to detect any potential discrimination. Third, due to differences in the OAI and MOST protocols, follow-up times differed by 15 months between the training and external validation sets. Nevertheless, the models were able to predict on the external data set with similar performance. Lastly, the presence of depression at 2 years was defined using the CES-D scale; although this tool has been validated for use in patients with chronic illness and OA, it is not considered a gold standard for the diagnosis of depression [27]. However, the CES-D questionnaire has the advantage of being brief, easy to understand, and requiring minimal training for the assessor [27].

Conclusions
This is the first study to apply ML classification models to predict depression in patients with knee OA using routinely collected patient data. The LASSO model offered the highest quality of prediction, with an AUC of 0.876 (95% CI 0.853-0.899) on external validation. The advantages of our method include the use of a large patient cohort and routinely collected data, as well as external validation on an independent data set. This tool offers a potential opportunity to assess a patient’s risk of future depression, facilitating early intervention. Further research is required to establish where such a tool would fit within the care pathway, and while the harmful effects of depression on knee OA are well documented, it will be necessary to confirm that early detection and management of depression in this population leads to the expected improvement in outcomes."
Predicting depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly adults using sleep data and clinical health markers: A machine learning approach,"Objectives Comorbid depression is a highly prevalent and debilitating condition in middle-aged and elderly adults, particularly when associated with obesity, diabetes, and sleep disturbances. In this context, there is a growing need to develop efficient screening methods for cases based on clinical health markers for these comorbidities and sleep data. Thus, our objective was to detect depressive symptoms in these subjects, considering general biomarkers of obesity and diabetes and variables related to sleep and physical exercise through a machine learning approach.Methods We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015–2016 data. Eighteen variables on self-reported physical activity, self-reported sleep habits, sleep disturbance indicative, anthropometric measurements, sociodemographic characteristics and plasma biomarkers of obesity and diabetes were selected as predictors. A total of 2907 middle-aged and elderly subjects were eligible for the study. Supervised learning algorithms such as Lasso penalized Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were implemented. Results XGBoost provided greater accuracy and precision (87%), with a proportion of hits in cases with depressive symptoms above 80%. In addition, daytime sleepiness was the most significant predictor variable for predicting depressive symptoms. Conclusions Sleep and physical activity variables, in addition to obesity and diabetes biomarkers, together assume significant importance to predict, with accuracy and precision of 87%, the occurrence of depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly individuals.","Recently, machine learning has been successfully applied to predict depression, from the diagnosis to treatment response, through the use of multimodal wearable devices [39], 24-h locomotor activity data [40], and predictive features extracted from neuroimaging data [41]. However, none of these studies is solely based on ordinary, widely available clinical data. Here, we revealed that excessive daytime sleepiness is the most important feature to predict the presence of depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly Americans. Community-based studies focused on the elderly population of different countries, which investigated the association or prevalence of EDS in depression, support our findings by showing a significant association between EDS, depressive symptoms, and the severity of depression [42]. Also, an increased risk of depression is related to daytime sleepiness compared to other sleep-wake disorders and medical conditions such as obesity and diabetes [43]. Furthermore, longitudinal research revealed that a decrease in depressive symptoms is one of the main predictors of remission of EDS [44]. EDS is characterized by the difficulty of maintaining wakefulness and alertness during the daytime, being a cause of traffic and workplace accidents, leading to damage to life and health [45]. It partially results from chronic sleep deprivation [46], unrested and insufficient [47]. Particularly in older adults, fragmented sleep, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep-related disorders also reduce total sleep time [48]. Chronic sleep deprivation affects the serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsible for the physiological response to stress, whose action causes changes in serotonin receptors (5-HT1A) and in the neuroendocrine response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) release [49]. These alterations are similar to the underlying neuronal processes of depression, which present hyperactivity of the HPA axis marked by the hypersecretion of ACTH and glucocorticoids [50] and a decrease in the availability of serotonin [51]. Animal model studies described that sleep deprivation for up to eight days causes gradual postsynaptic desensitization in the serotonin receptor (5-HT1A), and this persists even after sleep recovery [52]. Moreover, chronic sleep deprivation sensitized the HPA axis, resulting in elevated levels of ACTH and CORT after every 20-h period of sleep deprivation for seven days [53]. When evaluating total self-reported sleep duration, we observed that individuals with symptoms of depression slept on average longer than those with no symptoms. Most studies, however, have reported a strong association between short sleep duration and depression [22], with participants suffering from depression reporting up to 40 min less sleep [54]. The association between the level of depressive symptoms and sleep duration in the elderly seems to be non-linear [55], although extremely short sleep duration (less than 4 h of sleep) is associated with a higher risk of presenting symptoms of depression. Other studies including middle-aged and elderly participants, emphasized that short sleep duration is a risk factor for both incident and recurrent depression, with equal risk probability for both age groups [56]. On the other hand, long sleep duration (≥9) in the elderly is associated with EDS, which may reflect poor sleep quality in these individuals [57]. In addition to increased sleep duration in symptomatic participants, they also exhibited a delay in sleep onset and offset when compared with asymptomatic participants. This result is consistent with the literature and a typical finding in depression [58]. Higher BMI and WC were observed in our sample of individuals with depressive symptoms, compared to healthy volunteers, which is in accordance with the literature. American women have been reported to show a greater probability of the occurrence of depressive symptoms when their BMI is above 30 kg/m2. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis study reported that volunteers with obesity are 1.18 times more likely to manifest depressive symptoms than those with a healthy weight range [59]. We also found lower levels of HDL in individuals with depressive symptoms compared to those without symptoms, despite being within the normal range for the age group. By contrast, there was no significant difference between groups in the levels of total cholesterol, with both having levels within the range considered normal. A growing body of evidence supports that low levels of HDL are associated with the occurrence of depressive symptoms [10,11]. Other studies have shown that reduced levels of total cholesterol are not associated with depression and more severe symptoms in the elderly [60,61]. However, there are studies showing, in both middle-aged and elderly men, an association between reduced levels of TC and depressive symptomatology, representing an increased risk of developing it [12,13]. Significant differences between groups were also observed in the level of C-reactive protein (CRP). Several studies have reported results supporting our findings by showing an association between increasing levels of plasma CRP with an increased risk of depression [62]. Moreover, higher levels of CRP have been significantly associated with greater severity of depressive symptoms [8]. However, it is important to emphasize that the mean CPR values verified in both groups in the present study suggest systemic inflammation, which demonstrates how the general population shows signs of inflammation. Physical activities of a recreational nature, from moderate to vigorous intensity levels, were less frequent among subjects with depressive symptoms. Similar results were obtained in a study that sought to characterize groups with depression through cluster solutions, evidencing a propensity of depressive subjects to avoid moderate recreational activities [63]. There is evidence among middle-aged and older adults that recreational physical activities, both vigorous and moderate, contribute to a decrease in more severe depression [64]. For instance, physical activity is generally associated with a reduced proportion of subjects exceeding a PHQ-9 score > 10, which indicates greater severity of symptoms of depression [65]. These results are in line with expectations since it has been shown that depressive patients avoid recurrent practices of moderate to vigorous physical activities, dedicating less time to them when compared with subjects without depression [26]. This trend is even more frequent among older individuals, with a higher risk of low physical activity [66]. It can be explained mainly by limitations in mobility, pain, and discomfort. In addition, the association between low levels of physical activity and depression is also due to somatic conditions related to increased functional limitations, increased use of medication and psychosocial factors in individuals over 60 years of age [67]. Furthermore, sedentary behavior was prevalent in the group with symptoms of depression. These data corroborate results that show an association between depression and decreased minutes of physical activity [68]. Furthermore, even the chance of developing depression is increased by sedentarism [69].Some important limitations in the present study are worth mentioning. For example, only weekday data for self-reported sleep onset, sleep offset and sleep duration data were available, which prevented us to analyse the instability in the sleep-wake behavior between weekdays and weekends. In addition, we did not have access to objective data, such as actigraphy, which would provide more accurate information about both the sleep-wake cycle and an estimate of the total time spent during the week in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Moreover, sleep data was obtained only from questionnaires, without specific and objective assessment of sleep efficiency and sleep quality, which may have also affected the associations. Finally, even though NHANES uses a multistage, stratified design, to produce a representative sample of the civilian resident population in the Unites States of America, causality or the direction of the relationships are limited due to its cross-sectional study design. the models developed in this research cannot be applied to other countries with different cultures and ancestralities. However, our model is important as a starting point for researchers in developing specific algorithms for particular situations."
Predicting future onset of depression among community dwelling adults in the Republic of Korea using a machine learning algorithm,"Because depression has high prevalence and cause enduring disability, it is important to predict onset of depression among community dwelling adults. In this study, we aimed to build a machine learning-based predictive model for future onset of depression. We used nationwide survey data to construct training and hold-out test set. The class imbalance was dealt with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. A tree-based ensemble method, random forest, was used to build a predictive model. Depression was defined by 9 or more on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression Scale 11 items version. Hyperparameters were tuned throughout the 10-fold cross-validation. A total of 6,588 (6,067 of non-depression and 521 of depression) participants were included in the study. The area under receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.870. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.862, 0.730, and 0.866, respectively. Satisfactions for leisure, familial relationship, general, social relationship, and familial income had importance in building predictive model for the onset of future depression. Our study demonstrated that predicting future onset of depression by using survey data could be possible. This predictive model is expected to be used for early identification of individuals at risk for depression and secure time to intervention.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","In this study, we successfully built a machine learning-based predictive model for future depression. The AUROC (0.870), overall accuracy (0.862), sensitivity (0.730), and specificity (0.866) shows that this model could be practically used for screening adults who are prone to have depression later. To the best of our knowledge, this machine learning-based model is the first to predict future onset of depression by using longitudinal nationally representative community-dwelling adults. It was not possible to directly compare our results with previous studies that used clinical samples; therefore, the level of predictability is higher than previous studies with clinical samples [23,24] in which the AUROC values ranged from 0.66 to 0.69 [23] and 0.63 to 0.76 [25]. We suggest that the superiority of our predictive model over the studies of clinical samples might have arisen from the heterogeneity and severity in the clinical sample. Indeed, clinical sample of depression consists of highly heterogeneous individuals in perspective of clinical [26], genetic variants [7], and peripheral risk factors such as inflammation [27]. Hence, once depression had occurred, it would be difficult to accurately predict prognosis of depression. That is the point of which this study targets. By focusing on the prediction of future depression among community sample, we could establish predictive model with good performance measure.

From the analysis of feature importance in the RF algorithm, baseline depression showed the most importance. However, the importance of the baseline depression alone was less than 10 % of total feature importance. Indeed, only 40 out of 283 baseline depressive cases remained to be depressed for the consecutive two years.

Interestingly, domains in the quality of life such as satisfaction for health (1st), satisfaction for social relationship (2nd), satisfaction for familial relationship (4th), satisfaction for job (5th), satisfaction in general (6th), and satisfaction for leisure (7th) scored high importance. The satisfaction for various domains of life has become increasingly important these days. In fact, familial and social relationship have been also important in the prevention and improvement of depression in the community sample [28,29]. Leisure activity had preventive effects for depression [30]. These results suggest that the social and familial connectedness and intimacy as measured by the satisfaction for familial and social relationship seem to reflect susceptibility for depression.

On the other hand, economic issue had also importance for building predictive model. Receiving basic living allowance (9th) was in the top ten of feature importance. This is in line with a recent study which reported that the income of house has close association with depression [31]. These results raise a possibility that although socioeconomic status is not necessarily related with the onset of depression, poor economic conditions may limit to the access to the healthcare utilization, which in turn contribute to depression.

There are several limitations to be discussed. We did not include biomarkers in our model due to the fundamental limit of the original survey in the KoWePS. Since there have been reported that numerous biological markers contribute to the pathophysiology of depression, particularly genetic variants, [7] the absence of biological factors could limit the predictive performance in this study. However, due to reports that numerous biological markers contribute, biological factors themselves do not guarantee successful prediction. For example, a previous study revealed that single use of biomarkers for predicting prognosis of depression resulted poor performance (AUROC_<_0.6) [23].

In summary, this study demonstrates machine learning-based predictive model for depression among adult community dwellers. Further studies that incorporate various types of predictive variables, such as biological, genetic, neuroimaging, and socio-environmental factors, are warranted. In addition, the optimal time and method of intervention for individuals who are at risk for depression should also be investigated in the near future."
"Predicting outcome with Intranasal Esketamine treatment: A machine-learning, three-month study in Treatment-Resistant Depression (ESK-LEARNING)","Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents a severe clinical condition with high social and economic costs. Esketamine Nasal Spray (ESK-NS) has recently been approved for TRD by EMA and FDA, but data about predictors of response are still lacking. Thus, a tool that can predict the individual patients’ probability of response to ESK-NS is needed. This study investigates sociodemographic and clinical features predicting responses to ESK-NS in TRD patients using machine learning techniques. In a retrospective, multicentric, real-world study involving 149 TRD subjects, psychometric data (Montgomery-Asberg-Depression-Rating-Scale/MADRS, Brief-Psychiatric-Rating-Scale/BPRS, Hamilton-Anxiety-Rating-Scale/HAM-A, Hamilton-Depression-Rating-Scale/HAMD-17) were collected at baseline and at one month/T1 and three months/T2 post-treatment initiation. We trained three different random forest classifiers, able to predict responses to ESK-NS with accuracies of 68.53% at T1 and 66.26% at T2 and remission at T2 with 68.60% of accuracy. Features like severe anhedonia, anxious distress, mixed symptoms as well as bipolarity were found to positively predict response and remission. At the same time, benzodiazepine usage and depression severity were linked to delayed responses. Despite some limitations (i.e., retrospective study, lack of biomarkers, lack of a correct interrater-reliability across the different centers), these findings suggest the potential of machine learning in personalized intervention for TRD.  2023 The Author(s)","This is the first machine learning study examining factors predicting response and remission in patients with TRD treated with ESK-NS. This statistical approach offers valuable insights into identifying phenotypes responsive to ESK-NS, informing treatment selection. Our prediction model accurately estimates outcomes: one-month response, 68.53%; three-month response, 66.26%; three-month remission, 68.60%.

4.1. Responder profiles: the role of anhedonia, anxiety, and bipolar features
Our study highlights the importance of anhedonia and hopelessness/pessimism as predictors of positive outcomes after three months of ESK-NS treatment, influencing both response and remission. This aligns with previous ketamine research, suggesting anhedonia as a central target (Lally et al., 2014, 2015; Mkrtchian et al., 2021; Nogo et al., 2022; Sterpenich et al., 2019; Vasavada et al., 2021). Intravenous esketamine studies support its potential anti-anhedonic effects in unipolar and bipolar patients (Delfino et al., 2021). Anhedonia and hopelessness share fronto-striatal dopaminergic pathways (Pettorruso et al., 2020; Pizzagalli 2014), involved in the reward network (Li et al., 2018). Recent findings reveal that prefrontal areas modulate these circuits through glutamatergic pathways, and hypoactivation leads to decreased hedonic function (Kokane et al., 2020). Ketamine and ESK-NS may restore hedonic function by modulating reward network circuits (Arnsten et al., 2023), explaining glutamatergic compounds’ potential as anti-anhedonic therapies.

Baseline measures of psychic activation and comorbidity with anxiety disorders were positive predictors of ESK-NS treatment response. These dimensions encompass inner tension, restlessness, motor tension, psychic anxiety, and general anxiety symptoms. Prior research indicates ketamine and esketamine's anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depression (Martinotti et al., 2023; McIntyre et al., 2020, 2021). Comorbidity with anxiety symptoms also positively impacted esketamine treatment response (Lucchese et al., 2021). As ketamine derivatives were initially anesthetic agents, their anxiolytic effect is consistent. Our findings suggest a new perspective for TRD treatment algorithms, highlighting anxiety's key role. Anxiety is often considered a predisposing factor for TRD due to poor response rates to conventional antidepressants and frequent co-occurrence during MDEs (Cepeda et al., 2018; Maj et al., 2020).

Our analysis emphasizes the potential predictive role of psychic activation and mixed-related symptoms (restlessness, inner tension, motor tension) for response/remission to ESK-NS treatment. Interestingly, inner tension emerged as a strong predictor of positive outcomes at T1 and T2. Often linked to mixed features, these symptoms affect around 30% of TRD subjects during a MDE (Suppes and Ostacher 2017). Previous studies (Martinotti et al., 2023; McIntyre et al., 2020) suggest glutamatergic agents’ potential in treating mixed symptoms in TRD due to their pharmacodynamic action, such as modulating neuronal excitability (d’Andrea et al., 2023). Hyperthymic temperament and comorbidity with bipolar disorder also indicate a good likelihood of treatment response. This holds considerable implications, particularly about the involvement of coexisting features in MDEs within the framework of TRD and TRDBD. Prior empirical data suggests an increased propensity for non-responsiveness among patients exhibiting mixed features concurrent with an MDE (Fornaro et al., 2020).

Growing evidence supports ketamine's effectiveness and safety in bipolar depression (Bahji et al., 2021; Roger S McIntyre et al., 2021; Wilkowska et al., 2021), while evidence for esketamine is preliminary (Delfino et al., 2021; Martinotti et al. 2023) (e.g., no RCTs for ESK-NS). About 60% of initially diagnosed unipolar MDEs are reclassified as bipolar depression (McIntyre and Calabrese 2019), with conversion rates increasing over time (Kessing and Andersen 2017). Shifting to a bipolar spectrum perspective, “soft” or “attenuated” features like hyperthymic temperament, mixed features, family history of BD, and (hypo)manic switches with antidepressants (Akiskal 2003) are linked to recurrences and treatment resistance in MDEs (Mazzarini et al., 2018). Our results suggest considering bipolar spectrum-related features in TRD treatment algorithms as predictors of ESK-NS response. Studying depression sub-phenotypes is crucial, as some forms unresponsive to conventional treatments may respond to novel glutamatergic therapies and belong to the bipolar spectrum.

4.2. Non-responder profile: prior unsuccessful rTMS, obsessive thoughts, recurrences, and suicidalit as negative predictors
Our model identifies significant negative predictors of response, offering valuable insights for clinicians. Notably, prior inefficacy of rTMS treatment is a negative predictor. This contrasts with earlier studies on ketamine, wherein its efficacy was similar for individuals with and without a history of neurostimulation treatments (Rodrigues et al., 2022).

However, although ESK-NS and rTMS are distinct antidepressant therapies, they may share underlying mechanisms of action. Both target prefrontal areas to restore proper connectivity between prefrontal regions and the cingulate cortex (Arnsten et al., 2023). While rTMS primarily targets left DLPFC hypoactivation, ESK-NS directly impacts the cingulate cortex, reducing hyperactivation and indirectly restoring top-down control (Arnsten et al., 2023). We could speculate that individuals not responding to rTMS and ESK-NS may have depression without prominent DLPFC-cingulate cortex imbalance. In this perspective, a recent head-to-head preliminary study shows similar response and remission rates in TRD patients treated with rTMS and ESK-NS, with the former showing a more rapid action (Pettorruso et al., 2023). However, our finding and previous data doesn't exclude exploring the potential synergistic effects of these combined approaches.

The presence of obsessive symptoms was linked to negative responses. Obsessive thoughts often manifest as ruminative thoughts in depressive episodes (Ehring 2021). Maladaptive traits like anankastia may contribute to depression recurrence and pharmacological resistance, highlighting the need for combined approaches (Maj et al., 2020). Aberrant activity in the Default-Mode Network has been linked to ruminative and obsessive thoughts (Koch et al., 2018; Tozzi et al., 2021). Glutamatergic agents act on prefrontal components of the executive control network (Arnsten et al., 2023), but their impact on DMN activity is less understood (Hamilton et al., 2015). We speculate that ruminative/obsessive depression resistant to ESK-NS may respond to therapies rebalancing DMN activity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), like psychedelics (Barba et al., 2022).

Intriguingly, higher baseline suicidality predicts poor ESK-NS treatment response at T1 and T2. This, however, does not contest the previously documented anti-suicidal properties of ESK-NS (Mahase 2021), as our study did not investigate the drug's direct impact on suicidal ideation. Our finding underscores the intricate nature of suicidality. From a clinical perspective, suicidality is a remarkably heterogeneous construct, spanning an array of clinical manifestations - from suicidal ideation to instances of deliberate self-inflicted harm. It is commonly associated with the co-occurrence of personality disorders and is typically recognized as an indicator of the most severe form of MDE. Suicidality also amplifies the likelihood of recurrence, an additional adverse predictor identified in our model. Taken together, our data suggest that ESK-NS exhibits diminished efficacy in treating more complex, chronic forms of depression associated with important negative prognostic factors (i.e., suicidality) and characterized by a decrease in functional ability (i.e., difficult-to-treat depression) (McAllister-Williams 2022).

4.3. Late responders: could benzodiazepine use and depression severity delay ESK-NS response?
In our model, several factors interfered with early response to ESK-NS, with concurrent benzodiazepine use and depression severity being the most significant. This contrasts with a previous post-hoc analysis on ESK-NS RCTs that didn't find the use of benzodiazepine to affect ESK-NS action negatively (Diekamp et al., 2021). This difference could be due to the opposing effects of benzodiazepines and ESK-NS on glutamate/GABA balance. Benzodiazepines inhibit glutamate activation by activating GABAa interneuron receptors (Haefely 1984), while ESK-NS increases glutamate activity by antagonizing the NMDA receptor (Zanos et al., 2018). Thus, benzodiazepine use may slow ESK-NS action and reduce its efficacy.

Certain variables indicating high depression severity (psychomotor retardation, emotional withdrawal, self-neglect) predicted early unresponsiveness to ESK-NS. Notably, these features didn't predict T2 response and remission. This discrepancy suggests that high depression severity and benzodiazepine treatment might not impact ESK-NS effectiveness but rather delay response. Reducing benzodiazepines could speed up clinical response, and the most severe patients may need longer ESK-NS treatment for mood improvements.

4.4. Study limitations
A key limitation of our study is the heterogeneity of settings and methods due to its naturalistic design. This may have led to underestimating selection bias or inconsistent methods, but it also reflects real-world scenarios, enhancing the applicability of the results. Another limitation is the smaller sample size compared to previous machine-learning studies (Pigoni et al., 2019), which limited our ability to draw significant conclusions. However, the robust statistical analysis and cross-validation schema (Varoquaux 2018) suggest that the findings are not over-inflated. The T2 dropout rate (31/149 subjects) could also affect the study's overall significance. Developing inter-rater reliability among different centers wasn't possible, but evaluations were conducted by well-trained psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, ensuring good reliability and data reproducibility.

Another significant limitation of this study is the lack of biomarkers in our predictive model. Previous research has demonstrated that incorporating biological measures can amplify the overall precision of ML algorithms, additionally providing an objective quantification (Li et al., 2022). Given the inherent nature of this study—multicentric, real-world, and retrospective— the integration of such biological measurements was not feasible.

5. Conclusion
Our study suggests that machine-learning models can predict ESK-NS treatment outcomes using sociodemographic factors and clinical phenotyping. Despite limitations, these findings may aid clinicians in identifying subjects more likely to respond to ESK-NS. Anhedonic features, comorbid anxiety, and mixed symptoms predict better responses in TRD patients, while chronic and complex depressive disorders are less likely to achieve positive outcomes. The concurrent use of benzodiazepine and high depression severity delay the treatment response. If confirmed in larger samples, these machine learning-based results could help expand personalized medicine approaches in psychiatry."
"Predicting the naturalistic course of depression from a wide range of clinical, psychological, and biological data: a machine learning approach","Many variables have been linked to different course trajectories of depression. These findings, however, are based on group comparisons with unknown translational value. This study evaluated the prognostic value of a wide range of clinical, psychological, and biological characteristics for predicting the course of depression and aimed to identify the best set of predictors. Eight hundred four unipolar depressed patients (major depressive disorder or dysthymia) patients were assessed on a set involving 81 demographic, clinical, psychological, and biological measures and were clinically followed-up for 2 years. Subjects were grouped according to (i) the presence of a depression diagnosis at 2-year follow-up (yes n = 397, no n = 407), and (ii) three disease course trajectory groups (rapid remission, n = 356, gradual improvement n = 273, and chronic n = 175) identified by a latent class growth analysis. A penalized logistic regression, followed by tight control over type I error, was used to predict depression course and to evaluate the prognostic value of individual variables. Based on the inventory of depressive symptomatology (IDS), we could predict a rapid remission course of depression with an AUROC of 0.69 and 62% accuracy, and the presence of an MDD diagnosis at follow-up with an AUROC of 0.66 and 66% accuracy. Other clinical, psychological, or biological variables did not significantly improve the prediction. Among the large set of variables considered, only the IDS provided predictive value for course prediction on an individual level, although this analysis represents only one possible methodological approach. However, accuracy of course prediction was moderate at best and further improvement is required for these findings to be clinically useful.  2018, The Author(s).","Our findings indicate that from a wide range of clinical, biological, and psychological predictors, only severity of baseline depressive symptoms (measured by the IDS self-report questionnaire) was a significant predictor of different course trajectories of depression. We were able to predict the presence or absence of a unipolar depression diagnosis after 2 years with an AUROC of 0.66, and to discriminate between three course trajectory groups with an AUROC of 0.69 for rapid REM, 0.63 for gradual IMP, and 0.66 for a CHR course of depression.

Prediction of outcome in psychiatry is notoriously hard, due to heterogeneity of disorders, broad comorbidities across disorders, and due to clinical categories defined without a priori biological validity28. The performance of our models will need to improve in order to be translatable to clinical practice, but is comparable to previous ML studies predicting the naturalistic course of depression. For example, a study by Kessler and colleagues9 observed an AUROC of 0.63 for predicting high chronicity, defined as an episode lasting most days throughout the year, and AUROC’s between 0.71 and 0.76 for predicting other measures indicative of a 10- to 12-year illness course of depression, such as high persistence of MDD, hospitalization, and disability caused by MDD, and suicide attempts. Kessler et al.9 based their prediction models on baseline clinical measures alone, including symptoms of MDD and parental history of MDD, mania–hypomania, anxiety disorders, and externalizing disorders. The contribution of each individual clinical measure to the overall prediction was not assessed, so we cannot infer whether the prediction of their outcomes was also driven by severity of symptoms as observed in the present study.

Our most accurate models achieved a slightly lower AUROC of 0.69 for predicting an illness course characterized by rapid remission compared with the AUROCs found in Kessler et al.9, which is arguably less extreme (and therefore likely harder to predict) and a more prevalent outcome than outcomes considered by Kessler and colleagues9. Highest AUROC’s were found by Kessler et al.9 for models predicting hospitalization, disability, and attempted suicide, which was reported in only 3.2–5.8% of the total sample. However in our study, the prevalence of a remitted course of depression was 44%. Therefore, despite the smaller AUROCs, the positive predictive value (PPV) of our models is higher (between 33 and 68% PPV for a given outcome definition in the present study (Supplemental Figure S2), compared with PPV between 12.5% and 18.3% in the Kessler et al. study9 for 20% of subjects with highest predicted probability of a given clinical outcome), which means that our models have a smaller probability of false-positive classifications. Previous studies aimed at predicting first onset and new onset of an MDD episode during follow-up in people with no current MDD diagnosis using prediction algorithms based on demographic and clinical characteristics have found slightly higher AUROC of 0.75–0.79 in the training sample, which dropped to 0.70–0.73 AUC in independent replication samples12,13,29.

In addition to evaluating the predictive value of a model including all clinical, biological, and psychological variables, we aimed to identify (a minimum set of) individual predictors that reliably predict the naturalistic course of depression. For this purpose, we used a novel approach by combining penalized logistic regression and a stability selection method that selects predictive variables from a multivariate model while controlling for family-wise error. Of all included measures, we only identified the IDS as a statistically significant predictor. The total IDS score was positively associated with IMP and CHR course group membership, and with the presence of a depression diagnosis after 2 years, and negatively associated with a REM course and the absence of a depression diagnosis at follow-up. Although our method provides excellent control over type I errors, it is conservative and can miss predictive variables26. However, other variables only improved prediction of CHR course by 0.05 AUROC and all other outcome groups (presence of an MDD diagnosis, REM, IMP) by 0.01 AUROC. This is roughly equivalent to a difference of 0.04 Cohen’s d30, indicating a low added value of additional variables over and above the IDS. Interestingly, a subsequent exploratory analysis that we performed to identify which individual items of the IDS contributed most to the prediction showed that only the items “Feeling sad” (for predicting the presence of an MDD diagnosis at follow-up) and “Response of your mood to good or desired events” (for predicting the three different course trajectories) were identified as significant predictors. Performance of models using only these two items was similar to a model using all IDS items.

Similar results were found by Chekroud and colleagues10 in a recent study examining the predictive value of clinical measures for remission of MDD symptoms following a randomized 12-week citalopram treatment. Their model selected 25 best predictors from 164 sociodemographic and clinical features, and was able to predict remission with AUC of 0.70. Total severity of depressive symptoms, measured with the QIDS (shortened version of the IDS) was the most important predictor of treatment response. In line with the current study, treatment response could also be predicted with models using fewer variables, e.g., with only 15 and 10 variables with AUC of 0.69 and 0.68, respectively.

These findings suggest that other clinical measures possess very little or no prognostic value for course of depression—or remission following treatment in the Chekroud et al. study10—above and beyond severity of depressive symptoms. Biological variables, including inflammatory markers, cortisone, metabolic measures, BDNF, and vitamin D were able to predict only a chronic course of depression, although performance was worse than for clinical variables. This finding is in contrast to our previous studies within the same sample that showed group-level associations between lower cortisol awakening response7 and vitamin D deficiency6 and chronicity of unipolar depression. These findings show clearly that a group-level association does not imply the ability to make predictions for new cases at the level of individual subjects. This implies that although these baseline biological parameters can be associated with outcome based on group-level approaches, the effect sizes are probably too small to possess sufficient prognostic ability for long-term outcome in individual patients. In line with the current findings, in previous studies we found no group-level associations between a chronic course of depression and BDNF31, CRP, IL6 and metabolic syndrome32, despite clear group differences between healthy controls and unipolar depression patients. This may suggest that biological markers implicated in the etiology of unipolar depression are not necessarily good prognostic markers. Nonetheless, although we found no evidence for biological variables being informative for predicting naturalistic course of depression at the level of individual patients, they may still be useful for discriminating unipolar depression patients from other patient groups, e.g., bipolar disorder33, or for predicting response to, e.g., antidepressant treatment. Moreover, our course outcome definitions were based on DSM diagnosis and severity of symptoms. Symptom-based classifications are agnostic about underlying biological mechanisms and patients whose trajectory of symptoms is caused by different biological processes may be subsumed under the same category. As a consequence, our different course trajectory groups may have consisted of a heterogeneous set of patients with a similar course in terms of symptoms but distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and, hence, the full predictive power of biological variables may become only visible when patients are first stratified according to clinically relevant biological characteristics.

We previously showed promising results using task-based functional brain imaging34. This study was conducted in a smaller subsample (n_=_118) of the dataset used here, with identical LCGA course trajectory definitions. In this study, models based on neural patterns of activation in response to emotional facial expressions could discriminate chronic patients from patients with more favorable trajectories with up to 73% accuracy and outperformed models based on other neuroimaging modalities (structural magnetic resonance imaging, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging related to executive functioning with a chance level accuracy) or clinical data (accuracy of 69%). However, since the sample in our previous study was smaller, resulting in less stable results, and more homogeneous due to additional selection criteria, no strong conclusions can be drawn regarding the added value of neuroimaging data.
Limitations

The main limitation of the current study is a lack of replication of our findings in an independent dataset. Although within-sample cross-validation is known to be an approximately unbiased estimator of population generalizability35, it may not completely account for the different characteristics of data from different samples. An important next step is to validate our findings in independent data. An additional limitation is that due to the naturalistic setting of our study treatment was not controlled and limited information was available on treatment received during the follow-up period. The advantage of our naturalistic design is that the sample is more representative of depression in the general population. However, the prediction accuracy may have been higher in a more homogeneous and controlled sample. A final limitation of the study is that we tested only a one ML algorithm without the extensive tuning of all hyper-parameters. It is possible that a different analytic pipeline or an algorithm would yield slightly different predictions. We have done this mainly for the sake of simplicity so that stability selection is performed on the same algorithm that was also used to make predictions, and to avoid overly optimistic results due to model selection bias and overfitting36. Our results can, therefore, be considered as a conservative estimate of out of sample predictive accuracy."
Predicting therapy outcome in a digital mental health intervention for depression and anxiety: A machine learning approach,"Objective: Predicting the outcomes of individual participants for treatment interventions appears central to making mental healthcare more tailored and effective. However, little work has been done to investigate the performance of machine learning-based predictions within digital mental health interventions. Therefore, this study evaluates the performance of machine learning in predicting treatment response in a digital mental health intervention designed for treating depression and anxiety. Methods: Several algorithms were trained based on the data of 970 participants to predict a significant reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms using clinical and sociodemographic variables. As a random forest classifier performed best over cross-validation, it was used to predict the outcomes of 279 new participants. Results: The random forest achieved an accuracy of 0.71 for the test set (base rate: 0.67, area under curve (AUC): 0.60, p = 0.001, balanced accuracy: 0.60). Additionally, predicted non-responders showed less average reduction of their Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (_2.7, p = 0.004) and General Anxiety Disorder Screener-7 values (_3.7, p < 0.001) compared to responders. Besides pre-treatment Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder Screener-7 values, the self-reported motivation, type of referral into the programme (self vs. healthcare provider) as well as Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire items contributed most to the predictions. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that social-demographic and clinical variables can be used for machine learning to predict therapy outcomes within the context of a therapist-supported digital mental health intervention. Despite the overall moderate performance, this appears promising as these predictions can potentially improve the outcomes of non-responders by monitoring their progress or by offering alternative or additional treatment.  The Author(s) 2021.","Predicting therapy outcomes by utilizing ML has been done rarely within a DMH context. Therefore, this paper investigated the predictive performance of ML algorithms for the outcomes of a therapist-supported DMH intervention targeting depression and anxiety. This was evaluated using an independent test set of new participants, to avoid overfitting and reach more realistic performance estimates in a real-world setting. The selected algorithm predicted response to the treatment robustly above chance level with a comparable performance to similar designed studies from a non-DMH context. This, as well as clearly lower PHQ-9/GAD-7 decreases in the predicted non-responders, provides hope for implementing ML approaches in DMH. Besides PHQ-9 and GAD-7 values, a self-report of motivation, the WPAI values, as well as the type of referral into the programme added most to the predictive power of the algorithm.
As hypothesized, performance metrics were lower than several studies from a less application-heavy context,11 but comparable to those reported from studies with a similar aim, methodology and context.17,18 Therefore, this paper successfully demonstrated the applicability of an ML-based outcome prediction approach in DMH, while having a considerable sample size and high external validity, due to data coming from an actual real-world DMH programme. However, for potential applications of predicted outcomes, predictive performance would have to improve clearly. A potential advantage of ML approaches in DMH is that smartphone-based interventions can collect data that is not available in a traditional treatment setting. As data such as app usage has been demonstrated to be informative in predicting mental-health-related outcomes,41 making use of these data sources appears to be a promising path towards improved predictive accuracy. Also, as outcome prediction studies using neurobiological data regularly outperform the solutions using solely phenomenological data,11 such data could improve performance as well. As some DMH interventions, including the one whose data were used for this study, actually collect biological data as heart rate variability, this data could be integrated into a predictive model quite easily.
Also, whether knowing about those predicted to be non-responders allows efficient improvement of future treatment results depends not just on the accuracy of the algorithm but also on how the predictions are actually used. First studies suggested that monitoring patients, for whom low outcomes are predicted, can help to improve their outcomes.42 This appears as a promising use case also for a DMH setting, as the monitoring would be easy to implement and not too cost-intensive. Additionally, studies that allocate patients to treatments based on outcome predictions demonstrated superior outcomes43 or lower costs44 and thus highlight another group of interventions that could be built on top of the presented algorithm. However, other studies failed to show the superiority of tailored treatment,45 therefore, more research is needed to evaluate individualized treatment procedures based on predicted outcomes before definite conclusions can be made. Finally, it should be noted that besides the technical ability to predict outcomes, there are also numerous ethical challenges that need to be considered for using outcome predictions, such as potential biases of the used algorithm46 or potential negative side effects on other variables than outcomes.47 For example, offering additional treatment based on predicted outcomes might increase costs in an unscalable way.
In addition to the overall moderate accuracy of the model derived in the current investigation, the chosen approach had some other limitations. First, due to the dataset coming from a naturalistic setting, there was a considerable amount of missing data. Also, missingness was mostly not random, which is an assumption of several advanced imputation techniques,48 but due to changes in the data collected during the intervention. This might have lowered the predictive performance, but also biased the variable importance. For example, the burnout score might have been a more informative predictor if there were not nearly 40% of the data missing. Second, there were considerable differences between the test set and the data the algorithm was trained on originally. This occurred, as the intervention was rolled out into a new population with partly different population characteristics. This might have lowered the predictive performance as well, though the ability to make predictions across diverse populations might also be seen as a strength, proofing external validity of the chosen approach.
Third, comparable to similar studies,49 the chosen approach lacks a realistic baseline. Particularly in approaches where easily interpretable data such as questionnaires are used, it might be possible that human clinicians could predict therapy outcomes above chance level as well, and potentially even better than an algorithm. This was rarely explicitly tested, although an approach showing that ML predictions failed to outperform human therapists in forecasting outcomes in alcohol addiction50 highlights that collecting and testing against realistic baselines is quite relevant. Fourth, this paper took a very conservative approach on hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, acknowledging the risk that every decision made on a train set increases the risk of overfitting the algorithm, even when using cross-validation methods.51 Though hyperparameter tuning undeniably can improve an algorithm’s performance,11particularly with increasing sample size and the potential integration of behavioural and neurobiological data sources, future approaches would likely benefit from some additional decisions regarding the algorithms specification. Making these decisions over time and evaluating them on new incoming data could help to minimize the risk of overfitting. Fifth, the use of LOCF for handling missing data are appropriate under the assumption that those disengaging from the programme did not experience any additional improvements but may introduce bias if participants experience worsening of symptoms after dropping out. Additionally, LOCF is not robust when data are not missing at random (MNAR). However, suitable alternatives within this predictive modelling framework are lacking. Finally, the importance of the strongly correlated predictors was likely overestimated in the feature importance approach.37The final approach in this paper did not use feature selection as this did not reveal significant improvements in performance over the cross-validation procedure. However, as evident in the limitations in interpreting the chosen feature importance approach, feature selection can also increase the interpretability of ML approaches. Interpretability appears particularly relevant for novel applications of ML in real-world settings, as it might benefit the trust of those using it.52 Therefore, future similar minded approaches might choose to integrate feature selection more willingly, not just to benefit model’s performance but also its interpretability.
This paper predicted the response to a DMH intervention addressing depression and anxiety. While the reached performance was similar to studies from other settings, this performance was only moderate and would need to increase to monitor outcomes or influence the treatment decisions. Integrating behavioural and neurobiological data, as regularly collected from DMH interventions, might help to improve predictive accuracy and get closer towards more precise, individualized mental healthcare."
"Prediction Models of Functional Outcomes for Individuals in the Clinical High-Risk State for Psychosis or with Recent-Onset Depression: A Multimodal, Multisite Machine Learning Analysis","Importance: Social and occupational impairments contribute to the burden of psychosis and depression. There is a need for risk stratification tools to inform personalized functional-disability preventive strategies for individuals in at-risk and early phases of these illnesses. Objective: To determine whether predictors associated with social and role functioning can be identified in patients in clinical high-risk (CHR) states for psychosis or with recent-onset depression (ROD) using clinical, imaging-based, and combined machine learning; assess the geographic, transdiagnostic, and prognostic generalizability of machine learning and compare it with human prognostication; and explore sequential prognosis encompassing clinical and combined machine learning. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multisite naturalistic study followed up patients in CHR states, with ROD, and with recent-onset psychosis, and healthy control participants for 18 months in 7 academic early-recognition services in 5 European countries. Participants were recruited between February 2014 and May 2016, and data were analyzed from April 2017 to January 2018. ain Outcomes and Measures: Performance and generalizability of prognostic models. Results: A total of 116 individuals in CHR states (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [5.1] years; 58 [50.0%] female) and 120 patients with ROD (mean [SD] age, 26.1 [6.1] years; 65 [54.2%] female) were followed up for a mean (SD) of 329 (142) days. Machine learning predicted the 1-year social-functioning outcomes with a balanced accuracy of 76.9% of patients in CHR states and 66.2% of patients with ROD using clinical baseline data. Balanced accuracy in models using structural neuroimaging was 76.2% in patients in CHR states and 65.0% in patients with ROD, and in combined models, it was 82.7% for CHR states and 70.3% for ROD. Lower functioning before study entry was a transdiagnostic predictor. Medial prefrontal and temporo-parieto-occipital gray matter volume (GMV) reductions and cerebellar and dorsolateral prefrontal GMV increments had predictive value in the CHR group; reduced mediotemporal and increased prefrontal-perisylvian GMV had predictive value in patients with ROD. Poor prognoses were associated with increased risk of psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders at follow-up in patients in the CHR state but not ones with ROD. Machine learning outperformed expert prognostication. Adding neuroimaging machine learning to clinical machine learning provided a 1.9-fold increase of prognostic certainty in uncertain cases of patients in CHR states, and a 10.5-fold increase of prognostic certainty for patients with ROD. Conclusions and Relevance: Precision medicine tools could augment effective therapeutic strategies aiming at the prevention of social functioning impairments in patients with CHR states or with ROD.  2018 American Medical Association.

These results suggest that the individualized quantification of risk for impaired functional recovery is feasible despite site-associated heterogeneity and even without a prestudy calibration of sMRI procedures. Additionally, our inclusive study protocol running in clinical early recognition services facilitated the prognostic algorithms’ derivation and validation in patients representing some of the real-world diversity of CHR states for psychosis, depression, and comorbid psychiatric conditions. In this realistic test bed of model generalizability, we observed that role functioning was less clearly associated with predictors than social functioning when analyzed functional baseline data was used and was even less so when structural neuroimaging data was used. Role functioning may be more strongly determined by concurrent environmental and clinical factors than social deficits, leading to a greater degree of temporal fluctuation, which in turn potentially mediates differential associations with baseline clinical and neuroanatomical predictors (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).28,49,50 Future research should therefore assess whether the inclusion of environmental and clinical variables may improve the association with outcomes of role functioning deficits in similar help-seeking populations.

Importantly, we observed that combined models integrating clinical and brain structural data outperformed human clinical raters, suggesting that these models could improve the prognostic process beyond the current level. Interestingly, clinical raters overestimated patients’ social functioning improvement, particularly in the ROD group, in which only 27% of patients who ultimately experienced impaired outcomes were correctly identified. An additional sensitivity analysis showed that raters performed better in patients with ROD when impaired social functioning was categorized at lower cutoff values, suggesting that prognostic reasoning is sensitive to more severe functional deficits at follow-up (eTable 14 in the Supplement). In the group in CHR states, however, raters prognosticated best at the original cutoff levels but were less accurate than our machine learning models. This observation suggests that internal heuristics, which are potentially informed by the study groups’ differing clinical profiles, may influence clinicians’ prognostication. Taken together, rater-based prognostication may considerably overestimate vulnerable patients’ capacity to recover from social functioning deficits. Further research is needed to understand the factors governing functional prognostication in psychiatry to design algorithms that optimally mitigate prognostic bias.

The comparisons of models revealed that combined risk stratification generally outperformed unimodal prediction models. Despite the benefits of combined prediction models, however, our clinical models evaluating only 8 functioning variables would provide a cost-effective first-line strategy for estimating the risk of future social disability similar to the psychosis, depression, and suicide risk calculators recently proposed for secondary and outpatient care.12,21,23,51 In the group with CHR states, we were able to show that our functional risk calculator not only estimated future social impairment but also broader psychiatric morbidity (eTable 10 in the Supplement). These findings were corroborated by the observation that patients in CHR states with an MRI-based prognosis of impaired social functioning experienced unremitting symptoms, occupational disability, and poor quality of life (eFigure 10 in the Supplement). Thus, risk calculators for social impairment may provide accessible tools for a more generalized psychiatric risk screening for individuals in the CHR state. In contrast, the models specific to patients with ROD did not show a comparable prognostic generalizability. This discrepancy may align with recent findings revealing pronounced social cognition deficits in individuals with psychosis vs individuals with depression,52 and a close link between psychiatric morbidity, social functioning, and social cognitive processes in psychosis.53-55

Because MRI is cost intensive, we explored whether sequential predictive modeling could provide a rationale for the targeted use of structural neuroimaging (eFigures 12 and 13 in the Supplement). We observed pronounced benefits of blending sMRI and functional data in patients with increasingly ambiguous clinical decision scores, suggesting that the cost-benefit ratio of sMRI can be maximized by including it at a later, more elaborated stage of the prognostic workflow. Notably, this may include the assessment of transition risk based on the finding that only the sMRI-based model predicting social functioning showed significant prognostic generalizability in this context (eTable 10 in the Supplement). Taken together, these results may provide a first empirical account of prognostic improvements brought about by sequential multimodal risk assessment.30 Future studies should assess the added value of different data combinations, including neurocognition,18,56electroencephalography,20 sensor-based activity patterns,32 and language patterns,57 as well as multiomics information.58

We observed striking differences between the neuroanatomical patterns associated with different social-functioning outcomes in the patients in the CHR state and the patients with ROD. In patients in the CHR state, impaired functioning was associated with GMV alterations that represented a deviation from normal brain variation and that mapped to the salience network,59 the perisylvian language-associated system, the default-mode network, and the central executive network.60 Similar GMV reductions have been previously described in studies comparing the CHR, first-episode psychosis, and relapsing stages of psychosis with healthy control participants.61,62 Longitudinal data pointed to altered neurodevelopmental trajectories of these brain systems, suggesting a disturbed process of cortical reorganization in different stages of psychosis development.63-67 Structural dysmaturation affecting these brain systems may influence the capacity to switch between self-referential thinking, salience attribution, and executive functioning,68,69 thus disrupting complex processes of social cognition and behavior, and finally predisposing to poor functional outcomes of the CHR state.53

In contrast, impaired social functioning in the group with ROD was associated with extended prefrontal, insular, and lateral temporal GMV increments. This pattern also differentiated patients from healthy control participants. Brain volume reductions focused on the medial temporal lobe, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and temporooccipital cortices. While these abnormalities have been associated with earlier disease onset and poor outcomes of patients with major depression,70 findings in prefrontal and temporal areas have remained equivocal; for example, a recent VBM meta-analysis of ROD reported increased insular, thalamic, and temporal brain volumes and decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortical volumes.71 However, extended insular and prefrontal volume reductions were particularly found in patients with relapsing depression and early disease onset.72,73 Together with our findings, this may point to dynamic brain volume changes with potentially insufficient prefrontal compensatory processes in patients with ROD who fail to recover.

These largely nonoverlapping neuroanatomical patterns of impaired social functioning outcome explain the low MRI model transferability between the 2 diagnostic groups. This finding challenges the hypothesis of shared brain surrogates underlying transdiagnostic phenotypes, such as the Systems for Social Processes domain proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria.74 Alternatively, the recently revealed brain-behavioral heterogeneity of depression75 may have impeded our algorithms from detecting a salient and thus generalizable neuroanatomical signature of social functioning in the ROD group and/or reduced the generalizability of the CHR-specific model to an umbrella construct of depression. These alternative hypotheses call for more research using subtyping strategies76 to test whether the current neurobiological and outcome-associated heterogeneity of mental disorders can be deconvolved into patient strata with distinct prognostic profiles."
"Prediction of depression cases, incidence, and chronicity in a large occupational cohort using machine learning techniques: An analysis of the ELSA-Brasil study","Background Depression is highly prevalent and marked by a chronic and recurrent course. Despite being a major cause of disability worldwide, little is known regarding the determinants of its heterogeneous course. Machine learning techniques present an opportunity to develop tools to predict diagnosis and prognosis at an individual level. Methods We examined baseline (2008-2010) and follow-up (2012-2014) data of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), a large occupational cohort study. We implemented an elastic net regularization analysis with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure using socioeconomic and clinical factors as predictors to distinguish at follow-up: (1) depressed from non-depressed participants, (2) participants with incident depression from those who did not develop depression, and (3) participants with chronic (persistent or recurrent) depression from those without depression. Results We assessed 15 105 and 13 922 participants at waves 1 and 2, respectively. The elastic net regularization model distinguished outcome levels in the test dataset with an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.76-0.82), 0.71 (95% CI 0.66-0.77), 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.95) for analyses 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusions Diagnosis and prognosis related to depression can be predicted at an individual subject level by integrating low-cost variables, such as demographic and clinical data. Future studies should assess longer follow-up periods and combine biological predictors, such as genetics and blood biomarkers, to build more accurate tools to predict depression course. Copyright  The Author(s), 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press."," The present study investigated three machine learning models for classifying cases of depression and predicting incidence, and chronicity of depression within the ELSA-Brasil cohort, using baseline variables from wave 1 (2008–2010) as predictors, and the courses defined at wave 2 (2012–2014). The present study is the first to assess depression prognosis in a large sample using machine learning techniques. Particularly, we designed predictive models to distinguish (a) participants with depression from those without depression; (b) participants with incident depression from those without depression; and (c) participants with chronic depression (persistent or recurrent) from those without depression. We obtained AUCs ranging from 0.71 to 0.90, and balanced accuracies ranging from 68% to 82%.

Our first predictive model can be used to screen subjects with or at-risk of developing depression in a populational sample with a small set of features, easily accessible to the clinician. The evaluation of only individuals with depression requires extensive screening and diagnostic procedures that usually incur in great costs and small samples, many times unsuited for a proper machine learning analysis. Our second model can detect patients who will develop depression in the follow-up, and then can be used to monitor these cases, enabling both preventive measures and early intervention. Finally, our third model can be used to detect which patients will have a chronic course of depression, marked by either a persistent or recurrent trajectory, which are more likely to have a course marked by functioning impairment and poor outcomes, and that are likely to need tertiary care. In the context of a developing country, these may help to better allocate resources and improve assessment.

The models presented low PPV, given the low prevalence of depression in the sample, and high NPV. Nevertheless, in the context of a developing country with scarce resources, the algorithm may serve as a screening tool that can aid to prioritize resources in cases at-risk. Two other studies also evaluated depression in population-based cohorts. Wang et al. assessed 28 059 individuals from waves 1 and 2 from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related conditions, obtaining a model with C statistics of 0.7538 to discriminate those individuals that will develop a first-onset major depression (Wang et al., Reference Wang, Sareen, Patten, Bolton, Schmitz and Birney2014). Rosellini et al. used the same dataset to predict the risk of several psychiatric disorders, obtaining an AUC of 0.73 to predict depression. We found no studies predicting depression in population-based cohorts in developing countries (Rosellini et al., Reference Rosellini, Liu, Anderson, Sbi, Tung and Knyazhanskaya2020).

Predicting which individuals are at-risk to convert to depression can enable timely and personalized preventive strategies to take place, shifting our focus from only treating acute episodes to directly intervening in the course of the disorder. This may yield a substantial impact to ease the burden directly associated with depression, such as cognitive and functioning impairments (Lépine & Briley, Reference Lépine and Briley2011), high risk for suicidal behavior (Bostwick & Pankratz, Reference Bostwick and Pankratz2000; Ösby, Brandt, Correia, Ekbom, & Sparén, Reference Ösby, Brandt, Correia, Ekbom and Sparén2001), and decreased quality of life (Brenes, Reference Brenes2007). In addition, it could impact also in mortality and disability rates, as well as in the economic and family burden associated with the disorder (Kessler, Reference Kessler2012). For example, depression is a risk factor for clinical diseases such as diabetes (Brown, Majumdar, Newman, & Johnson, Reference Brown, Majumdar, Newman and Johnson2005), coronary heart disease (Gan et al., Reference Gan, Gong, Tong, Sun, Cong, Dong and Lu2014; O'Neil et al., Reference O'Neil, Fisher, Kibbey, Jacka, Kotowicz, Williams and Pasco2016), and autoimmune diseases(Andersson et al., Reference Andersson, Gustafsson, Okkels, Taha, Cole, Munk-Jørgensen and Goodwin2015), with patients being twice as likely to die prematurely when compared to subjects without depression (Lépine & Briley, Reference Lépine and Briley2011). Our findings show a potential application of machine learning in predicting incidence, persistence, and remission of depressive episodes at an individual level. In addition, the models developed in this study are easy to implement, since all variables can be accessed at any moment by a clinician, without incurring in additional costs. Interventions focused on the course of the disorder can be designed to target the relevant factors selected in the predictive models, since from all included variables, only age, sex, and ethnicity are not modifiable (Andersson et al., Reference Andersson, Gustafsson, Okkels, Taha, Cole, Munk-Jørgensen and Goodwin2015).

Comorbidities were between the most relevant predictive features in all models. This is in accordance with a previous study by our group that showed large effect sizes for OCD and anxiety disorders to predict incident and persistent depression, using traditional statistical methods (Brunoni et al., Reference Brunoni, Santos, Passos, Goulart, Koyanagi, Carvalho and Benseñor2020). The present study differs from our previous one as we employed more variables, tested more outcomes, and used a machine learning approach. Our findings are also in accordance with a recent meta-analysis of 66 prospective studies that showed that anxiety disorders predict depressive disorder, with effect sizes of 2.58 (1.81–5.2) for GAD, 2.06 (1.71–3.97) for SAD, and 5.60 (4.21–6.01) for OCD (Jacobson & Newman, Reference Jacobson and Newman2017). Some authors also consider the presence of high anxiety traits as a phenotype with an increased predisposition to stress-induced depression (Weger & Sandi, Reference Weger and Sandi2018). While SAD was the most important feature to differentiate depressed from non-depressed patients, it had an intermediate relevance for the other outcomes.

Regarding medication use, the use of benzodiazepines had an intermediate relevance for the three models. The use of antidepressants had an intermediate relevance for most models, except for the one predicting incident depression, in which it was the fourth more relevant feature. Of note, we decided to include use of antidepressants in all our models because patients may be using these for other reasons than being depressed, such as treatment of chronic pain, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. For example, there is evidence that subjects with GAD not treated with antidepressants have a higher risk to develop a depressive episode (Goodwin & Gorman, Reference Goodwin and Gorman2002). When performing a sensitivity analysis removing this variable for models 1 and 3, the first model had a mild decrease in performance, while the third remained at a similar value.

Among all sociodemographic features, the most relevant for all models was sex, being the third most relevant feature to predict incident and chronic depression, and the sixth more relevant to distinguish between depressed and non-depressed patients. The role of sex in depression is well-known, with women being twice as likely to develop depression (Kuehner, Reference Kuehner2003), although there is no conclusive evidence of its role in remission, recurrence, or persistence (Salk, Hyde, & Abramson, Reference Salk, Hyde and Abramson2017). The difference in incidence seems to be higher during adolescence, the period which was not included in our population. Having a university degree was the sixth more important variable to predict chronic depression, although it was discarded by the model of incident depression. Other sociodemographic variables had an intermediate to small relevance in the models. Age, for example, was among the five less relevant features in all models. This could be explained by the age range of our sample (35–74 years) and the fact the incidence is higher during adolescence and early adulthood (Saluja et al., Reference Saluja, Iachan, Scheidt, Overpeck, Sun and Giedd2004).

Depression rates observed in the present study were lower than expected in Brazil, in which higher depression rates have been reported (Brunoni et al., Reference Brunoni, Santos, Passos, Goulart, Koyanagi, Carvalho and Benseñor2020). Our depression rates might be lower due to several reasons, such as differences in variables associated with depression (such as age and socioeconomic position) and occupational cohort characteristics, as civil servants enrolled have advantages such as job stability and healthcare access not necessarily available to the Brazilian population. Therefore, ecological replication of our findings is warranted.

Our study had some limitations. Since this is an occupational cohort, it is uncertain if the findings can be generalized to a community sample. Due to the nature of the sample, unemployment, which is known as a risk factor for both depression and a more pernicious course of depressive symptoms, could not be included as a predictor. Although the lack of a large set of features can be considered a limitation, since other variables could improve further the model performance, it can also be seen as an advantage, since a small set of features that are easy and fast to collect makes a more feasible tool that can be used in large populations with small costs. In addition, we had a large sample size available, which makes the machine learning process more robust. Another limitation lies in the fact that the machine learning model uses the features to predict the outcome class, but these features are not necessarily causal factors for it, and thus the directionality predictors–outcome is hard to establish, especially regarding psychiatric comorbidities. It is also important to notice that the selected variables and their relevance are bound to the model, population, and predictors selected, and using different algorithms or parameters may alter the selected features and their relevance. In this sense, although machine learning can provide some insights into pathophysiological mechanisms or risk factors, it is not an appropriate and conclusive analysis for this purpose. Finally, an important limitation is the short follow-up period, which may have influenced the high rates of false positives found, and the fact that the CIS-R only evaluates the week before the assessment. Because of that, relevant data to the courses of the depressive disorder may be lost and even depressive episodes may not be accounted for, while for a more reliable determination of depressive trajectories, more frequent evaluations and longer periods of follow-up are required."
Prediction of depression onset risk among middle-aged and elderly adults using machine learning and Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging cohort,"Background: Early identification of the middle-aged and elderly people with high risk of developing depression disorder in the future and the full characterization of the associated risk factors are crucial for early interventions to prevent depression among the aging population. Methods: Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) has collected comprehensive information, including psychological scales and other non-psychological measures, i.e., socioeconomic, environmental, health, lifestyle, cognitive function, personality, about its participants (30,097 subjects aged from 45 to 85) at baseline phase in 2012–2015. We applied machine learning models for the prediction of these participants' risk of depression onset approximately three years later using information collected at baseline phase. Results: Individual-level risk for future depression onset among CLSA participants can be accurately predicted, with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.791 ± 0.016, using all baseline information. We also found the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale coupled with age and sex information could achieve similar performance (AUC 0.764 ± 0.016). Furthermore, we identified existing subthreshold depression symptoms, emotional instability, low levels of life satisfaction, perceived health, and social support, and nutrition risk as the most important predictors for depression onset independent from psychological scales. Limitations: Depression was based on self-reported doctor diagnosis and depression screening tool. Conclusions: The identified risk factors will further improve our understanding of the depression onset among middle-aged and elderly population and the early identification of high-risk subjects is the first step for successful early interventions.  2023","In this study, we showed that individual level risk for developing depressive disorder in the middle-aged and elderly population can be accurately predicted (best model has a test set AUC 0.791 ± 0.016) by using machine learning algorithms and comprehensive survey information collected approximately three years before. The developed model has higher performance compared to previous studies on predicting depression onset in the elderly population (test set AUC 0.629) (Su et al., 2021), in the military population (test set AUC 0.671) (Sampson et al., 2021) or in the occupational cohort (test set AUC 0.71) (Librenza-Garcia et al., 2021). Additionally, we identified the top factors, personality trait emotional stability, life satisfaction, perceived health, social support and nutrition risk factors, important for predicting depression onset in the middle-aged and elderly population from the comprehensive survey predictors.

Previous research observed that depressed patients show a lower level of emotional stability compared to healthy controls (Thompson et al., 2012). Our results further indicates that higher emotional instability leads to higher risk of depression onset in about three years later among the middle-aged and elderly population. Furthermore, our results also indicate that a higher level of satisfaction with life leads to a lower risk of depression onset. This finding is largely consistent with previous study shows that life satisfaction level is associated with existing depression diagnosis (Gigantesco et al., 2019). In addition, we identified poor self-rated and perceived mental health are related to high risk of depression onset. The finding is consistent with previous studies that poor self-rated mental health is associated with prolonged antidepressant therapy among patients with depression, and with the utilization of mental health services (Fleishman and Zuvekas, 2007). Our results highlighted the importance of subjective well-being, life satisfaction, self-rated and perceived mental health in predicting the incidence of depression in the middle-aged and elderly population. Previous studies have also identified social support as a predictive factor for depression (Gariépy et al., 2016). Our results confirmed that more functional social support is related to a lower risk of depression onset among middle-aged and elderly population. Previous research on the association between malnutrition and depression is controversial. Some reported that there is no association between malnutrition and depression status among elderly without heart diseases (Daniel et al., 2021; Toffanello et al., 2014), while others reported that elderly with malnutrition are associated with higher risk of depression (Davison et al., 2019; Maier et al., 2021). Our result supports that high nutritional risk (Screen-8 AB risk score less than 38) is related to higher risk of depression onset in about three years later among the middle-aged and elderly population.

The CLSA participants with depression onset (baseline CES-D-10 score 5.46 ± 2.52) has already shown a higher degree of depressive symptoms at baseline phase compared to the peers without depression onset (baseline CES-D-10 score is 3.30 ± 2.46). Our results indicate that even when the score of the CES-D-10 scale of the CLSA participants did not reach the criteria to be screened as depression at baseline, a relative subthreshold high score of CES-D-10 scale could still be related to high risk of developing depression in the future. The higher the score of CES-D-10 scale, the higher chance the subject being predicted to have depression onset. Furthermore, a high level of psychological distress measured by K10 scale indicates a high risk of depression onset in about three years later. And the higher the score of K10 scale, the higher chance the subject being predicted to have depression onset. When coupled with age and sex variables, the CES-D-10 scale produced a test set AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.764 ± 0.016. This performance is comparable to, though worse than, the model that incorporated all available predictors in anticipating the onset of depression among CLSA participants. The introduction of information from the K10 scale into the model, in conjunction with the CES-D-10 scale, resulted in only a modest increase of 0.012 in the test set AUC. This implies that most of the pertinent information necessary for predicting depression onset within the K10 scale is already encompassed within the CES-D-10 scale. As the CES-D-10 scale only contains 10 items in the questionnaire, the developed model has a great potential in real-world applications to inform the future risk of developing depression for middle-aged and elderly adults with subthreshold CES-D-10 scores, in addition to its usage for screening present depression. Also, these results indicate it may benefit early intervention on the subjects with subthreshold depression symptoms to prevent the onset of depression in the future.

One of the limitations of the current study is that the definition of depression outcome relies on self-reported diagnosis and positive depression screening using CES-D-10 scale. Self-reported diagnosis is not as accurate as the depression diagnosis records from clinical psychologist and psychiatrist. In addition, even though CES-D-10 is a widely used as a depression screening tool in epidemiological studies and has been proved to have good consistency with medical diagnosis in hospital, the depression label derived from CES-D-10 is not a clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the depressive symptoms measured by CES-D-10 may be presented by bipolar disorder or minor depressive disorder. Another limitation is that, even though the developed model was fully validated on the hold out test sets, its utility in informing the individual-level risk in developing depression in the future cannot be tested now. We will update the validation results using the CLSA data collected in 2018–2021 when it is available to us. Despite these limitations, the results in this study are still valuable in identifying high risk middle-aged and elderly adults in developing depressive disorder and studying the risk factors for depression onset among middle-aged and elderly population. However, it is important to note that future research and validation are necessary before any application of our findings to clinical practice can be recommended.

5. Conclusions
In summary, we were able to predict the individual level's risk for developing depressive disorder among a large middle-aged and elderly population using machine learning algorithms. The individual-level risk prediction provides the opportunity in identifying the subjects with high risk in developing depressive disorder in the future, which is the basis for successful early interventions. The identified risk factors will further improve our understanding of depressive disorder onset among middle-aged and elderly population."
PREDICTION OF DEPRESSION USING MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS TAKING CONSIDERATION OF OVERSAMPLING,"Depression is a psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent sense of sadness and dullness. It is also known as a severe burdensome problem or clinical sorrow, and it impacts how a person feels, thinks, and behaves and triggers a slew of emotional and physical issues. Various components are liable for this issue, and many related sicknesses are expanding because of this infection. It is not just at risk for well-being perils, yet also produces perilous social offense, like self-destruction and family misuse. In this study, we used machine learning methods such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB). We also used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to survey the exhibition assessment of arrangement results. These machine learning algorithms developed and analyzed Confusion matrices through data augmentation to assess the classification performance. This study used machine learning technologies to predict depression and revealed the significance of the trait. Then we have tried to utilize an oversampling technique that shows the distinction in model execution. Indeed, we wanted to see how well the recommended machine learning algorithms performed before and after rebalancing standardized data.

Prediction of Poststroke Depression Based on the Outcomes of Machine Learning Algorithms,"Poststroke depression (PSD) is a major psychiatric disorder that develops after stroke; however, whether PSD treatment improves cognitive and functional impairments is not clearly understood. We reviewed data from 31 subjects with PSD and 34 age-matched controls without PSD; all subjects underwent neurological, cognitive, and functional assessments, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE), computerized neurocognitive test (CNT), the Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), and functional independence measure (FIM) at admission to the rehabilitation unit in the subacute stage following stroke and 4 weeks after initial assessments. Machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, voting ensemble models, and statistical analysis using logistic regression were performed. PSD was successfully predicted using a support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel function (area under curve (AUC) = 0.711, accuracy = 0.700). PSD prognoses could be predicted using a support vector machine linear algorithm (AUC = 0.830, accuracy = 0.771). The statistical method did not have a better AUC than that of machine learning algorithms. We concluded that the occurrence and prognosis of PSD in stroke patients can be predicted effectively based on patients’ cognitive and functional statuses using machine learning algorithms.  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","In this study, we found that numerous cognitive and functional statuses were associated with the occurrence of PSD in stroke patients (Table 5 and Table 6). The recall and auditory attention omission error among the subitems of the MMSE and CNT, and dressing and locomotor function including ambulation among the subitems of the K-MBI and FIM were considered to be important features to predict the occurrence of PSD ((A) in Table 8). From decision-making models, we found that initial scores of visual and auditory attention were important for the prediction of PSD occurrence. A previous study revealed that the severity of depression and the decrease in visual and auditory tension tend to correlate to a weak degree in PSD patients [35], and depressive patients also showed impaired visual attention omission errors in a meta-analysis [36].
PSD is frequently seen in stroke patients, and it might worsen their cognitive and functional recovery and quality of life [37]. The prevention of PSD has been suggested in previous studies using various nonpharmacological modalities and antidepressants [38]; however, the evidence is very limited, and more clinical trials are needed to confirm effective prevention methods for PSD [39]. There is no doubt that early detection and treatment of PSD can help improve a patient’s prognosis; therefore, it is important to identify modifiable risk factors and their application to stroke patients. From previous studies, major risk factors from meta-analysis still debated according to researchers were identified as follows: previous history of mental disorders, including depression or anxiety; diabetes mellitus; cognitive impairment and functional deficits, including impairment in ADL; and other factors, such as old age, female sex, lesion location, and stroke type [40,41]. It should be noted here that risk factors, which are determined by statistical methods, cannot be used to develop a predictive model directly because risk factors contain results, course, or complications of target diseases, as well as causative factors and can be used as an explanatory model [42].
ML methods are a useful tool to overcome the limitations of statistical methods and help us to find predictive models [43]. Most previous ML studies on stroke patients have focused on the prediction of stroke occurrence or outcome [44], and only one study has revealed the relationship between stroke and mood disorders, including depression, apathy, and anxiety, using ML analysis [20]. In this study, we used various ML algorithms to predict PSD occurrence and prognosis for the first time, and the SVM linear and SVM with an RBF kernel were optimal to develop a predictive model for PSD. The RBF kernel is commonly used in SVM classification, has the advantages of the KNN algorithm, and overcomes challenges of using the RBF alone, such as the space complexity problem [45]. We also tried to apply other ML algorithms, including KNNs and RFs, which were effective in predicting stroke occurrence and prognosis in previous studies [44]. The VE algorithm is the combination of all ML models that were used in this study to improve model performance; however, its AUC and accuracy were not higher than those of the SVM linear or SVM with the RBF kernel (Table 9). The VE model uses multiple models for the analysis, which might contain pros and cons of each model, and individual algorithms, which are superior to other algorithms, can show better performance.
Whereas cognitive impairment and PSD are highly connected with each other, the effect of PSD treatment on cognitive improvement was not clear in previous studies. In one study, improved PSD patients showed greater cognitive improvement than nonimproved PSD patients showed [46], but in another study, PSD treatment only helped to improve attention [47]. Previous studies also revealed that motor recovery is obvious in treated PSD patients [48]. In our study, cognitive impairments such as visual memory visual span backward of the CNT, were closely related to improvements in patients with PSD ((B) in Table 8); however, further studies are needed to further confirm these relationships. We found that the educational period was strongly associated with recovery from PSD in the logistic regression analysis (AUC = 0.80). In previous studies, educational level might be associated with anxiety, depression [49], and poststroke cognitive impairment [50] and be a protective factor against PSD [51,52].
The statistical method of logistic regression analysis did not show a higher AUC than the optimal ML algorithm for the prediction of PSD occurrence and prognosis (Figure 3). During statistical processing of logistic regression, only a few parameters were included for the comparison of participants in the control and PSD groups or the Imp and NoImp groups, whereas ML algorithms included five parameters for the detection of AUC and accuracy. The sample size was important to reduce bias in regression coefficients [53], and a smaller sample size might have influenced the low AUC and accuracy of the regression analysis in this study. Nevertheless, ML algorithms in this study showed comparable performance to the existing statistical methods and might have been a suitable method to overcome a small sample size.
The SVM linear and SVM with RBF showed the best AUC among various ML algorithms for the prediction of PSD occurrence and prognosis; however, the specificity for the prediction of PSD occurrence and the sensitivity for the prediction of PSD prognosis was low, which means that these models might not accurately detect PSD among stroke patients or PSD patients whose symptoms improved depending on the cut-off selected. We studied 65 stroke patients, including controls without PSD, for the development of ML algorithm-based prediction models of PSD occurrence and prognosis; notably, many previous studies could not evaluate more than 60 stroke patients [16,54,55]. Small sample sizes can cause some problems, such as generalization, in the field of ML. In the medical field, the small sample size is due to an imbalance in which the number of people with the disease is smaller than the number of people without the disease. This imbalance problem can be addressed by introducing a method of oversampling relatively small data [56]. In this study, we performed a 5- and 10-fold stratified cross-validation set to compensate for the small sample size [57]. Although there are differences according to the ML algorithms, no significant difference was found between the two methods for the prediction of PSD occurrence and prognosis (Table 9). A prospective study can provide more accurate clinical information; therefore, it is possible to develop better predictive models. Pertinently, some prospective studies have been designed to predict PSD, but they were not replicable in an independent stroke group [6].
In this study, we used various ML algorithms to predict PSD occurrence and prognosis for the first time and showed better performance than the statistical method. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to ascertain applications for clinical use."
Predictive modeling of depression and anxiety using electronic health records and a novel machine learning approach with artificial intelligence,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly prevalent and impairing problems, but frequently go undetected, leading to substantial treatment delays. Electronic health records (EHRs) collect a great deal of biometric markers and patient characteristics that could foster the detection of GAD and MDD in primary care settings. We approached the problem of predicting MDD and GAD using a novel machine learning pipeline to re-analyze data from an observational study. The pipeline constitutes an ensemble of algorithmically distinct machine learning methods, including deep learning. A sample of 4,184 undergraduate students completed the study, undergoing a general health screening and completing a psychiatric assessment for MDD and GAD. After explicitly excluding all psychiatric information, 59 biomedical and demographic features from the general health survey in addition to a set of engineered features were used for model training. We assessed the model's performance on a held-out test set and found an AUC of 0.73 (sensitivity: 0.66, specificity: 0.7) and 0.67 (sensitivity: 0.55, specificity: 0.7) for GAD, and MDD, respectively. Additionally, we used advanced techniques (SHAP values) to illuminate which features had the greatest impact on prediction for each disease. The top predictive features for MDD were being satisfied with living conditions and having public health insurance. The top predictive features for GAD were vaccinations being up to date and marijuana use. Our results indicate moderate predictive performance for the application of machine learning methods in detection of GAD and MDD based on EHR data. By identifying important predictors of GAD and MDD, these results may be used in future research to aid in the early detection of MDD and GAD.  2021, The Author(s).","Our objective was to evaluate the importance and effectiveness of standard clinical data on the prediction of MDD or GAD. We used state-of-the-art novel machine learning methodologies to make predictions. Additionally, SHAP values were generated to explain and clinically validate our findings. We trained our model with_>_2500 participants and assessed the model's performance on a held-out test set. Although our accuracy metrics are comparable to previous studies predicting psychiatric outcomes, ours is unique in its primary reliance on routine biomedical and demographic features, rather than features with a known correlation to psychiatric outcomes. Previous studies that have looked at EHR to detect MDD have had the significant limitation of including predictive variables that would nullify the clinical utility of the model by relying on features that are directly indicative of known psychiatric illness (e.g. including psychiatric billing codes, which are based upon clinician diagnosis). Thus, this study is the first known study to predict MDD and GAD using EHR data with potential for predictive validity in detecting unknown psychiatric diagnoses.

Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been able to achieve slightly higher predictive performances ranging from 67 to 94%32. Nevertheless, perhaps due to the considerable expense of collecting MRI data, a common limitation of these was their small sample sizes. These studies also had considerable range in performance, and the due to their small sample sizes the results are highly inconsistent33. Moreover, using MRI to predict MDD is unrealistic when there is no other reason to justify an MRI, especially in an otherwise physically healthy college-age patient.

In addition to the complex machine learning approach and our carefully curated feature set, we are providing insights to the complex clinical appearance of MDD. Our pipeline, using SHAP values to visualize feature importance, provides not only the outcome prediction but the possible characteristics that a physician can identify when making a decision. These characteristics including mean arterial pressure, blood pressure, markers for low SES and general health markers have been shown to be previously associated with depression and anxiety34,35. Of note, despite the potential for these relationships between indicators of low SES and MDD and GAD, this study cannot rule out that this was based on biased physician diagnoses.

In further investigation of the predictors for generalized anxiety disorder, vaccination status may be reflective of overall poorer health outcomes in individuals with GAD36. Regarding the “marijuana use”, prior research demonstrates high comorbidity between anxiety disorders and substance use disorders37. With regard to the most important features driving major depressive disorder, there is research supporting overall poorer life satisfaction in individuals with MDD38, which may certainly include dissatisfaction with living conditions. Low interest and energy, DSM criteria for MDD, may contribute to difficulties maintaining satisfactory living conditions. Robust research to date indicates that individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have MDD39. “Difficulty memorizing lessons” may be related to concentration difficulties, also identified by the DSM as a clinical feature of MDD. An additional top predictive feature for both MDD and GAD is hypertension. Research to date corroborates this finding by demonstrating that individuals with either MDD or GAD are more likely to have hypertension40,41.

This information has the potential to allow health care providers to make informed recommendations for further screening regardless of whether the patient discusses or even recognizes his or her symptoms. This is important because as previously mentioned, it can take on average 6 or 14 years from onset of illness until diagnosis for MDD and GAD respectively17. Our study is one of the first of its kind to tackle this issue by not relying on previous psychiatric diagnoses or expensive imagine techniques to capture the disease in an early stage.

This study has several important limitations which deserve mention. One is that the original screening for the outcomes of MDD and GAD may not have captured all cases within the population. This, in addition to the study population, limits the generalizability of the results. Our dataset comes from French college aged students, who likely have baseline differences from other populations with psychiatric illness. Despite this limitation, our study still serves to show the predictive ability of mainly non-psychiatric variables for psychiatric illness. Such variables, further analyzed individually for their connection to psychiatric pathology, may prove the basis of further research. Another limitation of our study, which is fairly ubiquitous in mental health research is the low prevalence of anxiety and depression in our study population, as well as our sample size. Although this is a limitation in many studies of psychiatric nature, we were able to enhance our predictive power using a stacked ensemble model pipeline. Additionally, the lack of qualitative information (i.e., severity, subtype, etc.) regarding mental health diagnoses was not available to allow for a severity prediction analysis. Thus, future research should examine the potential for these important predictor to predict severity and subtype of MDD and GAD.

This research is an important step in the direction towards identifying potentially difficult to diagnose illnesses with readily available and easy to obtain information. Our tool, using an optimal sensitivity/specificity split would be able to capture two out of every three subjects with GAD and one out of two MDD cases while only incurring a 30% false positive rate. Because there are detrimental outcomes to both the patient and provider in a false positive, looking at the efficacy of case identification while requiring 70% specificity gives a reasonable idea of how many cases would be captured if this model were to be deployed in a clinical setting. These findings have shown promise on multiple fronts: Ability to use easy to obtain information to inform possible detection of MDD and GAD, further understanding of the demographic and biological characteristics associated with illness, and both the success and necessity for computational tools to inform psychological medicine. We believe, given a larger and more heterogeneous sample, this modeling technique could be used to elucidate the drivers of psychological illness and provide a tool that indicates the necessity of treatment with high precision and accuracy."
Predictive utility of symptom measures in classifying anxiety and depression: A machine-learning approach,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are highly prevalent, co-occurring disorders with significant symptom overlap, posing challenges in accurately distinguishing and diagnosing these disorders. The tripartite model proposes that anxious arousal is specific to anxiety and anhedonia is specific to depression, though anxious apprehension may play a greater role in GAD than anxious arousal. The present study tested the efficacy of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire anhedonic depression (MASQ-AD) and anxious arousal (MASQ-AA) scales and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) in identifying lifetime or current MDD, current major depressive episode (MDE), and GAD using binary support vector machine learning algorithms in an adult sample (n = 150). The PSWQ and MASQ-AD demonstrated predictive utility in screening for and identification of GAD and current MDE respectively, with the MASQ-AD eight-item subscale outperforming the MASQ-AD 14-item subscale. The MASQ-AA did not predict MDD, current MDE, or GAD, and the MASQ-AD did not predict current or lifetime MDD. The PSWQ and MASQ-AD are efficient and accurate screening tools for GAD and current MDE. Results support the tripartite model in that anhedonia is unique to depression, but inclusion of anxious apprehension as a separate dimension of anxiety is warranted.  2022","Investigating the modeling predictions by segmenting them into depression levels revealed that the model was good at predicting the mild, moderate, and moderately severe levels, whereas minimal and severe levels were difficult to detect because of the less frequent observations in the data collected. In the case of change in depression levels, the models detected decreases and increases with reasonable accuracy when the transitions were _1, 0, and 1. Rare changes such as _3, _2, 2, and 3 were detected with less accuracy. Data imbalance in terms of rare events such as severe changes in depression level, as shown in this study, can be a subject of further exploration, with possible strategies for synthetic data generation that can imitate sensor readings of participants with sudden or rare changes. Our study also looked into feature frequency and feature importance. Understanding the features that were selected and highly ranked by optimal-performing models can help in determining what sensors to focus on when analyzing data from passive sensor studies. We see that location, calls, and screen sensor-based features appeared most frequently in the optimal-performing models. Individuals experiencing depressive symptoms tend to move less, which can be captured by location data. Depression also causes participants to reduce their interaction with friends and family, and call-related features can play a role in characterizing this behavior. The screen time of individuals has been seen to be a reflection of mood, as explored in an earlier study [48]. Feature importance helps narrow down the exact features that contributed to modeling. We noticed that, for personalized models, screen time was a strong determining factor that could be a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown that prompted participants to use their phones with greater frequency. The feature importance presented in this study enabled us to make informed interpretable associations between sensor readings during changes in depression levels or scores. This can propel more research in the direction of more explainable or interpretable model building, especially for mental health–related diseases. Personalized models performed best in our study of adolescent depression data. Therefore, it was important to understand how personalized modeling, in particular the Accumulate Weeks approach, performed when subjected to incremental data addition as well as looking at how missing values affected model performances. The Accumulate Weeks modeling approach performed better when the variation in the depression scores of the participants was low. By contrast, when the variation in depression scores was high, the accuracy decreased significantly. Exploring the relationship between missing values and the performance metrics of the models allowed us to discover an inverse relationship. This bolsters our understanding that completeness of data can be an important factor in improving model performance. Our experimental analysis of missing data suggests a requirement for strategies to improve the collection of sensor data that can include stronger adherence to protocols by participants or more robust data-generating processes. Finally, we investigated how autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models performed in comparison with the ML modeling approaches used. The outcome of the comparison showed that ML models performed relatively better than the classic ARIMA models. However, the ARIMA models were more robust to sudden changes in comparison with the ML models, which were better at predicting smoother transitions. This result leads us to believe that, with possibly larger data sets, a combination of classic time-series approaches and ML-based approaches can be useful for participants with inherent trends or seasonality in their behavior."
Predictors of depression among middle-aged and older men and women in Europe: A machine learning approach,"Background: The high prevalence of depression in a growing aging population represents a critical public health issue. It is unclear how social, health, cognitive, and functional variables rank as risk/protective factors for depression among older adults and whether there are conspicuous differences among men and women. Methods: We used random forest analysis (RFA), a machine learning method, to compare 56 risk/protective factors for depression in a large representative sample of European older adults (N = 67,603; ages 45-105y; 56.1% women; 18 countries) from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE Wave 6). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the EURO-D questionnaire: Scores ≥ 4 indicated depression. Predictors included a broad array of sociodemographic, relational, health, lifestyle, and cognitive variables. Findings: Self-rated social isolation and self-rated poor health were the strongest risk factors, accounting for 22.0% (in men) and 22.3% (in women) of variability in depression. Odds ratios (OR) per +1SD in social isolation were 1.99x, 95% CI [1.90,2.08] in men; 1.93x, 95% CI [1.85,2.02] in women. OR for self-rated poor health were 1.93x, 95% CI [1.81,2.05] in men; 1.98x, 95% CI [1.87,2.10] in women. Difficulties in mobility (in both sexes), difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (in men), and higher self-rated family burden (in women) accounted for an additional but small percentage of variance in depression risk (2.2% in men, 1.5% in women). Interpretation: Among 56 predictors, self-perceived social isolation and self-rated poor health were the most salient risk factors for depression in middle-aged and older men and women. Difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (in men) and increased family burden (in women) appear to differentially influence depression risk across sexes. Funding: This study was internally funded by Colorado State University through research start-up monies provided to Stephen Aichele, Ph.D.  2022 The Author(s)","We used random forest machine learning to compare 56 variables for predicting depression in a large sample of middle-aged and older European adults. Results showed that self-reported social isolation and poor health were the top predictors, accounting for over 20% of variability in depression risk. Mobility problems, difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (for men), and family burden (family responsibilities interfering with personal aims, for women) accounted for approximately 2% of additional explained variability in risk. This demonstrates that social isolation, poor health, and difficulties in daily functional activities are a potent combination of risk factors closely linked to depression in later life.

Our findings amplify prior work identifying social isolation as a key predictor for depression among older adults.28,29 In 2020, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report stating that social isolation and loneliness represent a “significant yet underappreciated public health risk”.30 This report points to a growing concern that over 25% of community-dwelling Americans aged 65 and older are socially isolated, with 43% reporting feeling lonely. The current results indicate that older Europeans are likely similarly affected by problems of social isolation and depression.

Depression manifests both objectively and subjectively. Accordingly, in our study, we included a variety of social, health, cognitive, and functional variables, measured both objectively and subjectively. Of the top predictors for depression, subjective measures were most strongly represented. Social isolation (a composite measure based on subjectively reported lack of companionship, feeling left out, feeling isolated from others, and feeling lonely) was a much stronger predictor of depression risk than were more than 30 objectively measured sociodemographic, family, transactional, and social network-related variables. Self-reported social isolation was most strongly correlated with objective measures of living with a partner/spouse (r = -.29), mobility difficulties (r = .28), and distance to one's “closest other” (r = .22). Self-rated poor health was most strongly correlated with objective measures of mobility difficulties (r = 0.49), number of chronic diseases (r = 0.42), and physical inactivity (r = .33). These self-report measures of social isolation and poor health likely reflect health, mobility, and relational proximity problems that influence depression risk both directly and through their (potentially complex) interactions—and thus, compared with more narrowly defined risk factors, may be especially important for assessing risk outcomes in older adults.31

Beyond social isolation and general poor health, we found that problems with mobility (e.g., walking up stairs), difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (in men), and self-reported burden of family responsibilities (in women), collectively accounted for an additional 2.2% (in men) and 1.5% (in women) of variation in depression risk. Difficulties with day-to-day function/personal care can contribute to loss of independence and lower self-efficacy, which in turn has been associated with depression onset.32 The interruption of personal goals due to increased burden of care and/or other stressful life events has been linked to higher depression and more emotional distress.33 Taken together, these associations indicate that challenges in navigating functional aspects of daily life likely contributed to depression risk.

Globally, the prevalence of depression in women has been estimated to be nearly twice that of men,1 however factors predictive of depression in older adults have rarely been compared across sexes. We conducted analyses independently by sex, and results showed highly similar predictor patterns across women and men, despite large differences in later-life depression prevalence rates (18% in men vs. 32% in women) as measured by the EURO-D in this population-representative sample. The question then remains as to what accounts for the overall difference in prevalence rates across sexes if the key risk factors and predictive effects are so similar? In addition to sex-related differences in IADL and burden of family care, a much larger percentage of women vs. men were widowed (22.5% vs. 6.8%), and widowhood was positively correlated with depression (_ = .10 in women; _ = .07 in men), which suggests that differences in bereavement may have also played a role. Notwithstanding, future studies of sex-related differences in risk factors for depression among older adults may benefit by closer examination of sex/gender-related social disparities and gender role socialization, which may influence the expression of depressive symptoms.34
Limitations

Data for this study were cross-sectional (SHARE Wave 6), so we could not examine temporal associations between risk/protective factors and depression onset. The decision to analyze cross-sectional data was made on the basis that social network variables of key concern were only collected in SHARE Waves 4 and 6, with additional risk/protective factors of focal interest only collected at Wave 6. Additionally, although we found little evidence of an effect of chronological age on differences in depression risk, it has been suggested that stressful life experiences (SLE) more strongly influence depression risk in mid- vs. late-life.35 Further, depressive symptoms in women have been shown to be elevated during the menopause transition.36 Unfortunately, we could not include SLE and related antecedents for affective disorders in our analyses, nor were we able to account for menopausal status or potentially important neurophysiological measures (e.g., cerebral white matter lesion prevalence) as these variables were not available from SHARE."
Subjective and objective sleep and circadian parameters as predictors of depression-related outcomes: A machine learning approach in UK Biobank,"Background: Sleep and circadian disruption are associated with depression onset and severity, but it is unclear which features (e.g., sleep duration, chronotype) are important and whether they can identify individuals showing poorer outcomes. Methods: Within a subset of the UK Biobank with actigraphy and mental health data (n = 64,353), penalised regression identified the most useful of 51 sleep/rest-activity predictors of depression-related outcomes; including case-control (Major Depression (MD) vs. controls; postnatal depression vs. controls) and within-case comparisons (severe vs. moderate MD; early vs. later onset, atypical vs. typical symptoms; comorbid anxiety; suicidality). Best models (of lasso, ridge, and elastic net) were selected based on Area Under the Curve (AUC). Results: For MD vs. controls (n(MD) = 24,229; n(control) = 40,124), lasso AUC was 0.68, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.67–0.69. Discrimination was reasonable for atypical vs. typical symptoms (n(atypical) = 958; n(typical) = 18,722; ridge: AUC 0.74, 95 % CI 0.71–0.77) but poor for remaining models (AUCs 0.59–0.67). Key predictors across most models included: difficulty getting up, insomnia symptoms, snoring, actigraphy-measured daytime inactivity and lower morning activity (~8 am). In a distinct subset (n = 310,718), the number of these factors shown was associated with all depression outcomes. Limitations: Analyses were cross-sectional and in middle-/older aged adults: comparison with longitudinal investigations and younger cohorts is necessary. Discussion: Sleep and circadian measures alone provided poor to moderate discrimination of depression outcomes, but several characteristics were identified that may be clinically useful. Future work should assess these features alongside broader sociodemographic, lifestyle and genetic features.  2023 The Authors","4.1. Summary
Penalised regression models incorporating the subjective and objective sleep/circadian measures in UK Biobank were constructed to a) examine prediction performance for depression (vs. controls) and more severe outcomes within depression; and b) identify the optimal sleep/circadian predictors of each of the depression-related outcomes. A ridge regression model could discriminate moderately well participants with atypical vs. typical depression (AUC 0.74; 95 % CI 0.71–0.77). Discrimination was relatively poor for other models (AUCs < 0.70), although for MD vs. controls (including a separate subset of participants with onset of depression ≥1 year after data collection), and PND vs. controls, lasso models were close to the threshold for acceptable discrimination (MD: AUC 0.68, 95 % CI 0.67–0.68; PND: AUC 0.67; CI 0.64–0.70).

Several potentially important clinical markers of depression susceptibility were identified via feature selection and/or relative coefficient magnitude: insomnia symptoms, snoring, napping, difficulty getting up, sleep disorder, and actigraphy-derived duration of daytime inactivity (SIBD) and lower morning activity around 8 am. In follow-up analyses within a separate subset of UK Biobank participants, individuals self-reporting any of the first five (excluding actigraphy measures) were more likely to experience depression or more severe depression outcomes, particularly if a combination of these markers was present.

4.2. Discrimination performance
Sleep problems and circadian disruption are common in the general population, including in those who are otherwise healthy or suffer from psychiatric disorders other than depression (Walker et al., 2020). It is perhaps unsurprising therefore that sleep and circadian measures alone (alongside limited sociodemographic characteristics) did not discriminate those suffering from depression or more severe depression with a high degree of accuracy. Of note, a more liberal threshold for ‘acceptable’ discrimination of AUC > 0.6 is often applied (Cha et al., 2022; Yang and Berdine, 2017): all but two of our models surpassed this threshold, but only one exceeded the more conservative threshold applied here of AUC > 0.7 (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2004). The fact that inclusion of sleep/rest-activity predictors improved model performance beyond basic sociodemographics (for all outcomes except severe vs. moderate MD) and that the selected features were strongly associated with all outcomes reinforces the importance of the selected sleep/circadian variables in depression, and outcomes in depression. Consistent with this, sleep and circadian disruption have been linked longitudinally to onset of and worse outcomes in depression (Zhang et al., 2022) and may act as general markers of vulnerability to mental ill-health (Lyall et al., 2018).

The highest discrimination was for depression with atypical vs. typical symptoms. As the definition of lifetime history of atypical depression included (self-reported) hypersomnia during the worst period of depression (Brailean et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022), it is perhaps unsurprising that detailed sleep/rest-activity characteristics were useful in discriminating these two groups. However, it should be noted that i) 94 % of the atypical depression group did not meet criteria for current depression at the time of the MHQ, and ii) all other contrasts (MD/PND vs. controls and each depression subtype) were not defined based on any sleep characteristics but also showed widespread sleep/rest-activity differences. Findings are therefore consistent with suggestions that both depression itself, and more severe depression subtypes show reliable association with sleep and rest-activity characteristics regardless of current depressive state.

Discrimination performance may improve with addition of more fine-grained actigraphy data, e.g., epoched activity counts across the duration of the data collection period. Other machine learning methods, particularly non-linear approaches e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVM) with radial basis function or gradient boosting machine could also improve performance. Here, however, a principal aim was feature selection and interpretability of results, which penalised regression is well-suited to, and for which it has shown good performance in clinical psychiatric prediction models (Chekroud et al., 2021). Initial scoping using SVM-recursive feature elimination with several outcomes did not improve performance, consistent with a systematic review finding no improvement in clinical prediction for non-linear machine learning methods compared to logistic regression including penalised regression (Christodoulou et al., 2019). As the number of predictors here was relatively low, alternative non-linear machine learning methods may have a greater influence on performance in future, higher-dimensional studies where larger numbers of lifestyle, neuroimaging and genetic features are included, and non-linear effects are more likely.

Mental health data were not available at the time of actigraphy data collection, but at the time of the baseline and online follow-up MHQs, only around 2 % of participants with lifetime history of depression were thought to be currently experiencing a depressive episode. Findings therefore support suggestions that individuals with depression differ in terms of sleep/rest-activity characteristics from healthy controls even during periods of euthymia, and mirror previous findings of strong, reliable association between general sleep/rest-activity features and lifetime history of psychiatric disorders including depression (Lyall et al., 2018; Wainberg et al., 2021). Although addressing a different question, it is likely that classification accuracy would be improved if analyses were restricted to participants currently suffering a depressive episode.

It should be noted that in a clinical context, simple screening tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (including PHQ-9 and PHQ-2) outperform the above models in terms of AUC, sensitivity and specificity, and therefore remain the most efficient option for rapid screening of both depression diagnosis and depression severity (Cameron et al., 2011; Gilbody et al., 2007; Manea et al., 2016). Here, applying greater weight to sensitivity (Tables S17-S18) improved ability to detect cases, maximising sensitivity and NPV, at the cost of lowered specificity, PPV and overall accuracy. It could be argued that such weighting could be useful in a clinical context to capture all patients who may benefit from further screening and/or intervention, to reduce false negatives (Chubak et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2021). Our findings contribute to suggestions that individuals suffering from disturbed sleep and rest-activity patterns may be more likely to suffer from depression and more severe outcomes within depression regardless of current mood state, and may benefit from greater monitoring (Lovato and Gradisar, 2014; Wang et al., 2019).

4.3. Optimal predictors
A key aim was to identify which of the many available sleep and rest-activity variables were the most important predictors of depression-related outcomes. Several features occurred in the top 15 predictors in at least half of the models: difficulty getting up, insomnia symptoms, snoring, napping, sleep disorder, and actigraphy-derived SIBD and average activity around 8 am. The non-actigraphy measures from this list were strongly associated with the depression outcomes in a separate subset of UK Biobank participants who had not provided usable actigraphy data, particularly where multiple factors occurred in combination.

This set of optimal predictors may be consistent with disturbed sleep during the night (insomnia, snoring) resulting in sleepiness and inactivity during the day (difficulty getting up, napping, SIBD, lower morning activity) (Berger et al., 2021) as contributing factors to depression occurrence and greater severity. This may implicate insufficient/disturbed sleep as a greater contributor to depression-related outcomes than circadian disruption per se. Other circadian factors such as chronotype, and timing of actigraphy-derived M10, L5 and sleep midpoint were not among the top predictors when accounting for the full range of sleep/activity measures, despite previous findings linking later chronotype to depression risk (Vetter et al., 2018). Lack of circadian features among the top predictors may however have been linked to their collinearity with morning activity.

Two of the top predictors were based on actigraphy measurements: SIBD (duration of sustained inactivity bouts during the daytime), and activity between 8 am and 9 am. Coefficients and descriptive tables indicate those who spend more time inactive during the day and are less active in the morning are more likely to suffer from depression, and more severe depression, including depression with suicidality. This is consistent with recent findings that activity deficits are most pronounced in the morning in adults with depression symptoms (Smagula et al., 2021). It has been proposed that this association of reduced morning activity with depressive symptoms may be linked to sociopsychological factors such as reduced engagement in social and physical activity leading to rumination (Smagula et al., 2021). Reduced circadian entrainment and morning daylight exposure may be another factor: this has been linked to delays in sleep timing, shorter sleep duration, and reduced sleep quality (Blume et al., 2019). Some evidence suggests specific targeting of morning activity could be a useful clinical intervention for depression (Smagula et al., 2022). Findings that greater morning and evening activity and lower nocturnal activity were linked to reduced odds of suicidality are consistent with previous literature demonstrating association of reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behaviour with suicide risk (Vancampfort et al., 2019, Vancampfort et al., 2018): targeting of activity levels has been proposed as an intervention, and it is possible that activity monitoring could be of use in identifying individuals at greater risk of serious outcomes such as suicidality (Vancampfort et al., 2018).

While actigraphy-measured inactivity during the day, particularly morning-time, appears to be an important predictor of depression-related outcomes, most of the top predictors were based on self-report. Detailed actigraphy assessment over days/weeks may not be required to determine those more likely to show depression and more severe outcomes within depression, particularly as our exploratory analyses excluding actigraph-based measures demonstrated strong association of the subjective measures with depression and its severity. SIBD and morning activity could potentially be incorporated into questionnaires alongside the above self-reported sleep characteristics, for example at GP/psychiatrist assessments of those with depression, to identify individuals at greater risk of worse outcomes. While self-report can be flawed, e.g. sedentary behaviour is often underestimated and sleep problems overestimated, subjective measures show reasonable reliability (Alfano et al., 2015; Prince et al., 2020), and are less costly and invasive compared to actigraphy. Replication of current findings in other cohorts such as Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study may help clarify a) whether the factors identified here are useful markers of vulnerability to depressive disorders; and b) if so, whether subjective self-report measures are sufficient to identify at-risk groups.

4.4. Limitations
The intervals between collection of different data types may have limited discrimination performance: subjective sleep measures were collected during the baseline assessment (2006–2010) alongside some mental health data, actigraphy data were collected between 2013 and 2015, Mental Health Questionnaire data from 2016 to 2017, and linked health records could come from any time point before/after recruitment. Although sleep disturbances are relatively stable over time (Fatima et al., 2020), participants' sleep/activity habits may have varied between data collection periods, and/or may not have been representative of their typical habits or those around the time of the relevant depression outcome.

Similarly, as UK Biobank is a cohort of middle- to older-age adults, participants' sleep/circadian characteristics at the time of data collection may not reflect those from around the time of their depression onset (typically during adolescence/early adulthood; Solmi et al., 2022) potentially limiting associations and discrimination performance. Similar analyses in younger cohorts, e.g., ABCD, may yield greater insights into key risk factors as well as testing generalisability of the current prediction models. This is particularly important as actigraphy devices and methodology can differ markedly between studies and samples, further highlighting the need for assessment of generalisability (Fekedulegn et al., 2020; Patterson et al., 2023).

The restriction of analyses to those with valid actigraphy data allowed inclusion of all available sleep/rest-activity measures, both subjective and objective. Among this subsample, almost 40 % met criteria for lifetime history of depression: this is higher than previous estimates from the full UK Biobank sample or from other population studies (~27 %; Smith et al., 2013). This is likely due to exacerbated selection bias within the subsample, whereby individuals opting into the follow-up actigraphy investigation were slightly more likely to suffer from depression (see Lyall et al., 2022 for similar findings in the neuroimaging subsample). It is unclear why this might be, particularly as follow-up subsamples are typically associated with ‘healthy bias’ (Fry et al., 2017), but could be linked to increased interest in participating in health research among those suffering from depression (Adams et al., 2020). Reassuringly however, in exploratory analyses in an independent subset of UK Biobank participants without available actigraphy data (with lower depression prevalence), the key subjective sleep variables identified in most models were strongly associated with the depression-related outcomes. The UK Biobank's use of a single protocol and large sample size mean that while the sample and particularly subsamples may not be representative of the general population and should not be used for prevalence estimates, findings relating to exposure-disease associations are likely to be generalisable (Fry et al., 2017).

The direction of causality (if any) between sleep/circadian disruption and depression-related outcomes is not of current relevance to the prediction models reported: the predictors could contribute to discrimination whether they are a cause or consequence of the outcome measures, or both are linked to other, unmeasured factors. Causality is however of great theoretical and clinical interest, and future studies e.g., involving Mendelian Randomisation, and causal modelling including in younger cohorts (e.g., ABCD) will aim to address this.

5. Conclusions
Penalised regression models incorporating sleep and circadian rest-activity characteristics were able to discriminate moderately well those suffering depression with vs. without atypical symptoms, and discrimination of MD vs. controls and PND vs. female controls approached the cut-off for reasonable discrimination. Prediction for other depression-related outcomes (including MD with vs. without comorbid anxiety) was poor. Findings highlight several potentially important sleep/rest-activity related predictors of depression and its severity. Individuals experiencing difficulty getting up in the morning, insomnia symptoms, greater inactivity during the daytime, lower morning activity, sleep disorders, and who snore or take naps may be more likely to have a lifetime history of depression and worse depression outcomes, particularly when several of these factors co-occur together. Future studies incorporating these factors alongside additional sociodemographic, genetic and neuroimaging data may lead to improved discrimination performance."
Supervised machine learning to predict reduced depression severity in people with epilepsy through epilepsy self-management intervention,"Objective: To develop a classifier that predicts reductions in depression severity in people with epilepsy after participation in an epilepsy self-management intervention. Methods: Ninety-three people with epilepsy from three epilepsy self-management randomized controlled trials from the Managing Epilepsy Well (MWE) Network integrated research database met the inclusion criteria. Supervised machine learning algorithms were utilized to develop prediction models for changes in self-reported depression symptom severity. Features considered by the machine learning classifiers include age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, study type, baseline quality of life, and baseline depression symptom severity. The models were trained and evaluated on their ability to predict clinically meaningful improvement (i.e., a reduction of greater than three points on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)) between baseline and follow-up (<=12 weeks) depression scores. Models tested were a Multilayer Perceptron (ML), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting (GB). A separate, outside dataset of 41 people with epilepsy was used in a validation exercise to examine the top-performing model's generalizability and performance with external data. Results: All six classifiers performed better than our baseline mode classifier. Support Vector Machine had the best overall performance (average area under the curve [AUC] = 0.754, highest subpopulation AUC = 0.963). Our analysis of the SVM features revealed that higher baseline depression symptom severity, study type (i.e., intervention program goals), higher baseline quality of life, and race had the strongest influence on increasing the likelihood that a subject would experience a clinically meaningful improvement in depression scores. From the validation exercise, our top-performing SVM model performed similarly or better than the average SVM model with the outside dataset (average AUC = 0.887). Significance: We trained an SVM classifier that offers novel insight into subject-specific features that are important for predicting a clinically meaningful improvement in subjective depression scores after enrollment in a self-management program. We provide evidence for machine learning to select subjects that may benefit most from a self-management program and indicate important factors that self-management programs should collect to develop improved digital tools.  2022 Elsevier Inc.","Our goal was to utilize the rich aggregate of data collected from various epilepsy self-management programs (MEW-DB) to train machine learning models to predict depression outcomes and develop a computerized decision support tool [17], [18]. While the SVM model had the best overall performance, we found that all classifiers generally performed better than our baseline mode classifier. An analysis of SVM features revealed that baseline depression (PHQ-9 category), study type (i.e., intervention program goals), baseline quality of life (QOLIE-10), and race influenced the likelihood that a subject would benefit from participation in a self-management intervention.

It was unsurprising that SVM outperformed other selected machine learning classifiers, as SVM has been shown to perform well with smaller datasets that contain a relatively large number of features [19], [20]. There is also an abundance of evidence that SVM is superior to other supervised learning classifiers, especially for binary classification [21], [22]. Other strengths of SVM are its high generalizability and sound theoretical basis [20], [23]. Succinctly, the SVM classifier operates by dividing the data into two separate groups with a linear hyperplane that maximizes the distance between these groups [23], [24].

After training and selecting our top-performing classifier, we utilized SHAP to discern underlying feature-level trends in our data [15], [25]. The feature of highest importance was baseline PHQ-9 class, where a higher baseline PHQ-9 score (i.e., more severe depression) was associated with a greater predicted positive response to a self-management intervention. This could be explained by the fact that there is greater potential to observe an improvement in depression for subjects starting at a higher baseline level. However, it also indicates that baseline depression, assessed by the PHQ-9, may be a sensitive metric for targeting persons with epilepsy that would benefit most from enrollment in a self-management program.

Our feature analysis revealed that subjects enrolled in PACES had greater relative improvements in depression than subjects in TIME and SMART. This seems less likely due to one program outperforming the other, as all programs aided patients’ depression, but may instead reflect differences in the enrolled samples of each study. The PACES program focused on improving medical and psychosocial management and enrolled a general epilepsy sample [26], while SMART focused on reducing negative health events among high-risk individuals who had recent poorly controlled seizures or had crisis care events such as emergency room visits, hospitalizations or self-harm attempts [27]. The TIME intervention focused on improving epilepsy outcomes among people with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression [28]. Additional research is needed to investigate how diverse sub-groups with additional characteristics beyond those that were a focus of our model-testing respond to epilepsy self-management programs.

Furthermore, our negative control and external validation exercises serve to strengthen our model’s robustness and generalizability for use outside of MEW. Earlier work with PACES reveals that both intervention and control groups experienced eventual improvement in PHQ9 scores after 6_months, which could be a placebo effect from either being enrolled in a self-management study or natural fluctuations [26]. To reduce the potential for placebo contribution, we ran our control group through trained SVM as a negative control validation exercise and found it performed very poor compared to results on the MEW test dataset. Hence, these results help support that the observed effect that our SVM detects is not due to this placebo effect but from the intervention these subjects undergo in the study. Subsequently, an external validation exercise with outside datasets from independent epilepsy behavioral programs yielded results at least on par with the SVM’s average performance. This supports that our model is generalizable, making it a good candidate for use as a tool for outside data.

Our study demonstrates the utility of machine learning as a complementary tool for screening people with epilepsy who may benefit from enrollment in a self-management intervention. As machine learning classifiers output (1) a class prediction and (2) a confidence or likelihood related to the prediction, we have designed an online tool that can be accessed at [https://mlmewcalculator.github.io

]. Using this tool, providers can input baseline subject features (e.g., age, race, baseline QOLIE-10, baseline PHQ-9) to predict the likelihood that a subject will benefit from enrollment in an epilepsy self-management program. A sample of the user interface and output is provided as a supplementary figure (SFig. 4). This tool may be useful for guiding the clinical selection of patient populations that would benefit most from self-management interventions and providing patients with quantitative approximations of expected improvements after enrolling in an epilepsy self-management program.

This study must be viewed in light of a few limitations. Although the dataset was filtered to better harmonize time differences between baseline and post-baseline visits (i.e., different study follow-up time frequencies and durations), each program had different eligibility criteria and settings that could bias our results. Studies included in this MEW-DB sub-sample also did not require subjects to have clinically diagnosed depression, so we relied on subjective measures of depression (PHQ-9 scores). We also acknowledge that a 5-point PHQ-9 change is commonly used for clinical significance; however, this threshold was not used in our study, as it heavily skewed the balance of the target class in favor of no clinically meaningful change. Instead, a 3-point reduction in PHQ-9 was used to maintain a more balanced dataset, and as supported by Turkoz et al.’s finding, this threshold is a clinically meaningful improvement. Nonetheless, future work will use a larger sample population to assess 5-point changes in PHQ-9 scores. Regarding sample size, the generalizability of these findings was further limited by our exclusion criteria, which limited the number of subjects and studies included in model training. Additionally, our filtered dataset only contained data from three different studies, two of which were collected from the same testing center. We acknowledge that this may introduce sampling bias to the demographic results, such as race; however, we consider race an indicator of socioeconomic status and not a biological variable. More details on the socioeconomic status and study methods may be found in the original reports [26], [27], [28]. Despite these limitations, some strengths of this endeavor include a good representation of minorities in the dataset, insight into clinical and demographic features important for recommendations to a self-management intervention, and an online, user-friendly tool that clinicians may use to gauge potential outcomes if a person with epilepsy participates in a self-management program."
Trajectories of remitted psychotic depression: Identification of predictors of worsening by machine learning,"Background Remitted psychotic depression (MDDPsy) has heterogeneity of outcome. The study's aims were to identify subgroups of persons with remitted MDDPsy with distinct trajectories of depression severity during continuation treatment and to detect predictors of membership to the worsening trajectory. Method One hundred and twenty-six persons aged 18-85 years participated in a 36-week randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) that examined the clinical effects of continuing olanzapine once an episode of MDDPsy had remitted with sertraline plus olanzapine. Latent class mixed modeling was used to identify subgroups of participants with distinct trajectories of depression severity during the RCT. Machine learning was used to predict membership to the trajectories based on participant pre-trajectory characteristics. Results Seventy-one (56.3%) participants belonged to a subgroup with a stable trajectory of depression scores and 55 (43.7%) belonged to a subgroup with a worsening trajectory. A random forest model with high prediction accuracy (AUC of 0.812) found that the strongest predictors of membership to the worsening subgroup were residual depression symptoms at onset of remission, followed by anxiety score at RCT baseline and age of onset of the first lifetime depressive episode. In a logistic regression model that examined depression score at onset of remission as the only predictor variable, the AUC (0.778) was close to that of the machine learning model. Conclusions Residual depression at onset of remission has high accuracy in predicting membership to worsening outcome of remitted MDDPsy. Research is needed to determine how best to optimize the outcome of psychotic MDDPsy with residual symptoms. Copyright  The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","We identified two groups of persons with remitted MDDPsy based on trajectories of depression scores during continuation treatment with either sertraline plus olanzapine or sertraline plus placebo: those with a stable trajectory and those with a worsening trajectory. In the random forest model, the strongest predictor of membership in the worsening group was the severity of depression at onset of remission. The prediction accuracy of the machine learning model that included multiple predictor variables, including depression severity, was only marginally better than that of a logistic regression model that included depression severity alone (AUCs of 0.812 and 0.778, respectively). In contrast, a secondary random forest model that did not include depression severity was slightly less accurate (AUC of 0.772) than depression severity alone.

These findings have clinical implications. First, they indicate that assessing the severity of MDDPsy in remission is important in predicting outcome. The mean (s.d.) Ham-D17 score at the onset of remission was 4.6 (2.8) in the stable group and 7.9 (3.2) in the worsening group. Although both mean scores fall within the conventional range of remission of MDD in mid-life and older adults (Frank et al. Reference Frank, Prien, Jarrett, Keller, Kupfer, Lavori and Weissman1991; Reynolds et al. Reference Reynolds, Dew, Pollock, Mulsant, Frank, Miller and Kupfer2006), our findings indicate that there is value in knowing where an individual lies within this range, since lower scores predict a better outcome.

Second, measuring severity of depression in remission may be sufficient to predict clinical course during continuation treatment, without the need to assess other prognostic variables. Although the random forest model that contained multiple predictors was slightly more accurate than depression score alone, the 3.4% difference in their AUC is of doubtful clinical significance. This may indicate that depression severity at remission is correlated with other predictors considered in the random forest model. Interestingly, Song et al. (Reference Song, Qian, Sui, Greiner, Li, Greenshaw and Cao2023) found that subsyndromal depression severity predicted future case-level depression with similar accuracy to that of a machine learning model that included a number of psychological and non-psychological variables (AUCs of 0.764 and 0.791, respectively). From the perspective of patient and clinician, the administration of one measure (depression severity) is less burdensome, and more likely to lead to uptake in clinical practice, than the need to administer several measures.

Third, our findings raise an important question about state v. trait effects in the outcome of remitted MDDPsy. In some individuals, it possible that a more vigorous and/or a different treatment could further lessen depression severity, or eliminate symptoms entirely, thus resulting in a stable outcome (state effect). However, other individuals may be unable to achieve an asymptomatic state regardless of what treatment they receive and remain at risk for an unfavorable course of depression. In this case, the inability to achieve full remission serves as a trait marker of a phenotype that may have a distinct neurobiological signature. Further research is needed to disentangle these effects, and identify individuals with residual depression who can benefit from more vigorous or different treatment and determine how they differ biologically from persons with a trait-determined course.

Anxiety score at randomization baseline, when participants were in remission, also emerged as a strong predictor of worse outcome trajectory. The association of anxiety, either as a residual symptom of depression or as a comorbid disorder, with worse long-term outcome of depression is well documented (Buckman et al. Reference Buckman, Underwood, Clarke, Saunders, Hollon, Fearon and Pilling2018; Hardeveld et al. Reference Hardeveld, Spijker, De Graaf, Nolen and Beekman2010). In addition, psychomotor score at randomization baseline was a leading predictor of worse outcome. Although several factors have been implicated in risk of relapse and recurrence of MDD (Buckman et al. Reference Buckman, Underwood, Clarke, Saunders, Hollon, Fearon and Pilling2018; Hardeveld et al. Reference Hardeveld, Spijker, De Graaf, Nolen and Beekman2010; Wojnarowski et al. Reference Wojnarowski, Firth, Finegan and Delgadillo2019), our collective findings suggest that a focus on residual symptoms may be a fruitful area of inquiry to understand why some people with remitted MDDPsy have a poorer outcome than others.

There are limitations to the study. First, analyses were post hoc. Second, history of childhood trauma, personality traits, quality of interpersonal relationships, and life events and difficulties, which have been found to be relevant to relapse and recurrence of MDD (Buckman et al. Reference Buckman, Underwood, Clarke, Saunders, Hollon, Fearon and Pilling2018; Burcusa & Iacono, Reference Burcusa and Iacono2007; Perlman et al. Reference Perlman, Benrimoh, Israel, Rollins, Brown, Tunteng and Berlim2019), were not assessed in STOP-PD II and therefore could not be included in the machine learning model. Third, the study design precluded a nuanced analysis of psychosis in the machine learning model. In order to be eligible for the RCT, participants had to experience full remission of delusions and hallucinations during acute treatment and, then, remain free of psychosis during the 8-week stabilization phase. Thus, in contrast to depression severity, there was minimal variability in SADS delusion and hallucination scores at the point of remission and during stabilization. Fourth, the trajectory of Ham-D scores in the RCT was influenced by randomized treatment, in that participants treated with sertraline plus placebo had greater risk of relapse (which would have influenced the trajectory of Ham-D scores) than participants treated with sertraline plus olanzapine. It is possible that different variables would have predicted membership of worsening trajectory if the sample had been restricted to persons treated with sertraline plus olanzapine. However, the sample size was not large enough to allow separate analyses of each treatment group. Fifth, our findings are limited to the drugs that were used in STOP-PD II. Trajectories and/or predictors may have been different had other drug combinations been used.

Strengths of the study include the well characterized sample, the rigorous approach to measurement of variables, and the large and diverse number of variables available for the machine learning model (notwithstanding the absence of the specific variables noted above). Other strengths are the wide age range of participants in keeping with the broad age of onset of MDDPsy, the 36-week duration of the RCT, and the multiple points of measurement of the outcome variable.

To conclude, the strongest predictor of membership in the worsening subgroup was the severity of depression at onset of remission. The predictive accuracy of remission depression severity alone was comparable to that of a machine learning model that included multiple variables. This finding suggests that assessing the severity of depression at onset of remission may be sufficient to inform the outcome of depression during continuation treatment, without the need to measure other prognostic variables. Finally, there is a need for research to determine how to optimize the outcome of treated psychotic depression when residual symptoms persist.

Use of machine learning approach to predict depression in the elderly in China: A longitudinal study,"Background: Early detection of potential depression among elderly people is conducive for timely preventive intervention and clinical care to improve quality of life. Therefore, depression prediction considering sequential progression patterns in elderly needs to be further explored. Methods: We selected 1,538 elderly people from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS) wave 3–7 survey. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and six machine learning (ML) models were used to predict different depression risk factors and the depression risks in the elderly population in the next two years. Receiver operating curve (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the reference model and ML models. Results: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of logistic regression with lasso regularisation (AUC=0.629, p-value=0.020) was the highest among ML models. DCA results showed that the net benefit of six ML models was similar (threshold: 0.00-0.10), the net benefit of lasso regression was the largest (threshold: 0.10-0.17 and 0.22-0.25), and the net benefit of DNN was the largest (threshold: 0.17–0.22 and 0.25–0.40). In two ML models, activities of daily living (ADL)/ instrumental ADL (IADL), self-rated health, marital status, arthritis, and number of cohabiting were the most important predictors for elderly with depression. Limitations: The retrospective waves used in the LSTM model need to be further increased. Conclusion: The decision support system based on the proposed LSTM+ML model may be very valuable for doctors, nurses and community medical providers for early diagnosis and intervention.  2021","This study is based on CLHLS wave 3–7 (2002, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014) panel data of 1,538 elderly people, where population information, social economy, health and other variables are obtained. We use the LSTM model to obtain the predicted values __of different variables in the next two years and apply the predicted values __and six ML methods (logistic regression, lasso regression, RF, GBDT, SVM and DNN) to diagnose depression in the elderly population. The results show that the analysis framework combined with the LSTM model and other ML models shows excellent performance in the prediction of depression in the elderly population. Specifically, the LSTM+ML framework can characterise and merge complex high-order interactions between time patterns and variables for model prediction and successfully capture the correlation information between static data and dynamic data. This correlation information are integrated with temporal information extracted from dynamic data to improve depression prediction of the elderly population. In addition, the DCA results show that there are differences in the net benefit of the six ML models within different thresholds.

Thus far, the LSTM model has been successfully applied to many studies involving time series prediction, such as traffic flow prediction (Li et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2019), infectious disease prediction (Gu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2019) and human trajectory prediction (Shi et al., 2019; Zaroug et al., 2020). However, no research has analysed the prediction of LSTM model in the risk factors of depression in Chinese elderly. Most studies have also shown that, compared with traditional shallow models and autoregressive integrated moving average models, LSTM-based deep learning prediction models can capture time correlation more effectively, and using auxiliary data can significantly improve prediction performance (Chae et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b; Zhang and Nawata, 2017). This approach also provides possibilities for the study to predict the future depression tendency of the elderly by using nonclinical data. At the same time, this research provides potential for future clinical application of this field.

ML models based on LSTM technology can perform high-precision prediction tasks, and the AUC value of some models is close to 0.7. This result shows the feasibility of predicting the depression of the elderly based on the LSTM+ML technical framework. It also proves the accuracy and predictive ability of screening the risk factors of depression in the elderly in other research. Among all ML models, the performance of the lasso regression and DNN models is comparable to the reference model, and the performance of the SVM is significantly lower than the reference model. However, some ML models (lasso regression and DNN) show high AUC value and net benefit. This result may have the following reasons. Firstly, if a significant nonlinearity exists between the predictors and the outcome of depression in the elderly and the data between different categories of predicted results are unbalanced, then most ML models have better ability to deal with the nonlinear relationship between variables, probably becoming more suitable as classifiers (Kuhn et al., 2013). Secondly, the Euclidean distance, from which SVM relies, is not the best approach to deal with the classification of depression in the elderly. In addition, SVM is not robust in identifying outliers in the input variable space or feature space, and may be more affected by the imbalance of data classification (Hastie et al., 2009; Weston et al., 2001). Thirdly, considering the limited sample size of the unbalanced CLHLS longitudinal data between different waves, regularisation, cross-validation and dropout methods are used to minimise overfitting of the model; however, the reference model does not have an advantage in adjusting model parameters (Tibshirani, 2011).

When predicting depression in the elderly population, we should determine a threshold for identifying depressed and nondepressed elderly. Ideally, the model should have high PPV and NPV prediction accuracy. However, a trade-off is found between PPV and NPV. In identifying depression, the top priority is high PPV; Meanwhile, we also need to consider that elderly people at high risk of depression can be identified as much as possible, so we also need to consider sensitivity to identify more high-risk groups of depression. Therefore, a truly high-efficiency model needs to be better in the two indicators of PPV and sensitivity. Finally, we conducted a decision curve analysis that provides different service providers with more flexible choices. Service providers (such as doctors, nurses and community workers) can choose appropriate thresholds based on their domain knowledge. Specifically, it can be dynamically adjusted according to the prevalence level of depression in the elderly in the area or the ability of hospitals to recognize depression. If the prevalence in the area is high, the threshold of the machine learning model can be appropriately increased to obtain the highest net benefit. Meanwhile, high-level/psychiatric professional hospitals have a higher medical technology to identify depression than low-level hospitals, so the threshold level can also be appropriately increased to obtain the best net benefit.

In addition, we identify the importance of the predictors using the RF and GBDT models to minimise the dimensions of the predictors. We found that in the two ML models, the top important predictors are ADL/IADL, self-rated health, marital status, and arthritis. Meanwhile, some variables (such as smoking and cancer) are less important in both prediction models. The results show that when considering many factors to predict depression in elderly, establishing a low-dimensional decision support model, which can reduce the difficulty of collecting information for some medical personnel (especially community medical providers), is efficient."
Using machine learning approach to predict depression and anxiety among patients with epilepsy in China: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent comorbidities among epilepsy patients. The screen and diagnosis of anxiety and depression are quite important for the management of patients with epilepsy. In that case, the method for accurately predicting anxiety and depression needs to be further explored. Methods: A total of 480 patients with epilepsy (PWE) were enrolled in our study. Anxiety and Depressive symptoms were evaluated. Six machine learning models were used to predict anxiety and depression in patients with epilepsy. Receiver operating curve (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and moDel Agnostic Language for Exploration and eXplanation (DALEX) package were used to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models. Results: For anxiety, the area under the ROC curve was not significantly different between models. DCA revealed that random forest and multilayer perceptron has the largest net benefit within different probability threshold. DALEX revealed that random forest and multilayer perceptron were models with best performance and stigma had the highest feature importance. For depression, the results were much the same. Conclusions: Methods created in this study may offer much help identifying PWE with high risk of anxiety and depression. The decision support system may be valuable for the everyday management of PWE. Further study is needed to test the outcome of applying this system to clinical settings.  2023","Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent comorbidities among PWE (Kanner, 2016). Although many studies tend to find out the relationship between epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities, they didn't construct a solid model in predicting anxiety and depression among PWE. Even fewer study concentrated on the psychosocial factors influencing anxiety and depression in PWE (Cao et al., 2020). Quite few studies concentrated on the prediction of anxiety and depression in PWE (Doherty et al., 2021; Jackson-Tarlton et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017), and only Doherty et al. constructed a nomogram on predicting the risk of postoperative mood decline for individual patients prior to temporal lobe epilepsy surgery using neurobiological factors (Doherty et al., 2021).

ML models have been widely used among PWE in automated seizure detection, automated imaging analysis, pre-surgical planning and prediction of treatment outcome, etc. (Abbasi and Goldenholz, 2019). Yet, few studies used these algorithms in predicting psychiatric comorbidities in PWE. Results from our study suggest that anxiety and depression can be precisely predicted with certain ML models consisting of seizure-related factors and social factors included in this study. When predicting depression and anxiety in PWE, we need to find out these patients with emotional disorders as much and precise as possible. It is ideal to construct a model with high PPV, NPV and sensitivity. However, a trade-off is found between PPV and NPV. In clinical settings for screening depression and anxiety, high PPV is more valuable. In that case, a practicable yet efficient model needs to have high PPV and sensitivity. In our study, for anxiety, RF, GBM and MLP fulfilled the criterion. For depression, RF and MLP fulfilled the criterion, too. With DCA analysis for models predicting anxiety and depression, we realized that within different range of threshold probability, RF and MLP had the largest net benefit separately. Further, with the help of DALEX, we found out that RF and MLP had similar distribution of residuals in both anxiety and depression, which is narrower than other models, indicating they may have better performance in predicting anxiety and depression. In line with previous research (Huang et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2020), RF and MLP have emerged as the best performing algorithms for predicting affective symptoms. This may be due to their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships, which are frequently presented in mental health-related datasets. Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate model. Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a subset of the data, and the final prediction is based on a combination of the predictions made by each tree (Breiman, 2001; Dinh et al., 2019). This approach allows random forest to capture complex relationships between variables, while minimizing overfitting (Pavey et al., 2017). Other the other hand, multilayer perceptron, a type of artificial neural network, uses a supervised learning technique with backpropagation algorithm (Gupta and Raza, 2020). Multilayer perceptron algorithms can efficiently capture non-linear relationships and make accurate predictions (Rajaee et al., 2019).

Several known risk factors for anxiety and depression in PWE including gender, seizure frequency, epilepsy type, and number of anti-seizure medicine were included in the study (Dehn et al., 2017; Kanner, 2016; Zhong et al., 2021). However, since none of these seizure-related factors had a higher feature importance than felt stigma in the best predicting models for anxiety and depression (RF and MLP), our models further prove social factors including felt stigma are vital predictors for emotional disorder among PWE.

Apart from felt stigma, variables included in our studies were common epilepsy-related factors, which are included in the electronic health records (EHRs). With these features combining with felt stigma, an EHR-based prediction tool may offer help in screening depression and anxiety in PWE. By elevating the clinicians' attention on the risk of depression and anxiety, the rate of screening and referral for mental health care might be higher among PWE, yet it might be low if certain symptoms are neglected by neurologists because of busy clinical work. Our risk prediction model, by identifying PWE with elevated risk, may assist with tacitly raising clinician awareness of anxiety and depression in PWE and potentially increasing screening and referral rates.

5. Limitations
Several limitations exist in our research. First, this study based on cross-sectional data. In that case, we can't establish causal relationship between the factors included in our research and outcomes (depression and anxiety). Further longitudinal study is needed. Second, the sample size of our study was rather small. The ML algorithm might get more optimal performance with larger input. So, further testify of these models with more data is needed. Further, felt stigma itself may lead to patients withholding information from clinicians resulting in misdiagnosis.

6. Conclusion
In summary, this study demonstrates that a data-driven screening approach using machine learning epilepsy-related factors and psychosocial factors may be leveraged to reduce the healthcare provider burden of identifying anxiety and depression among PWE. Methods created in this study may offer much help in identifying PWE with high risk of anxiety and depression. The decision support system may be valuable for the everyday management of PWE. Further study is needed to test the outcome of applying this system to clinical settings."
Using machine learning to predict help-seeking among 2016–2018 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System participants with postpartum depression symptoms,"Background: Despite the importance of early identification and treatment, postpartum depression often remains largely undiagnosed with unreported symptoms. While research has identified several factors as prompting help-seeking for postpartum depression symptoms, no research has examined help-seeking for postpartum depression using data from a multi-state/jurisdictional survey analyzed with machine learning techniques. Objectives: This study examines help-seeking among people with postpartum depression symptoms using and demonstrating the utility of machine learning techniques. Methods: Data from the 2016–2018 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a cross-sectional survey matched with birth certificate data, were used. Six US states/jurisdictions included the outcome help-seeking for postpartum depression symptoms and were used in the analysis. An ensemble method, “Super Learner,” was used to identify the best combination of algorithms and most important variables that predict help-seeking among 1920 recently pregnant people who screen positive for postpartum depression symptoms. Results: The Super Learner predicted well and had an area under the receiver operating curve of 87.95%. It outperformed the highest weighted algorithms which were conditional random forest and stochastic gradient boosting. The following variables were consistently among the top 10 most important variables across the algorithms for predicting increased help-seeking: participants who reported having been diagnosed with postpartum depression, having depression during pregnancy, living in particular US states, being a White compared to Black or Asian American individual, and having a higher maternal body mass index at the time of the survey. Conclusion: These results show the utility of using ensemble machine learning techniques to examine complex topics like help-seeking. Healthcare providers should consider the factors identified in this study when screening and conducting outreach and follow-up for postpartum depression symptoms.  The Author(s) 2022.","The current research answers important questions about help-seeking among patients with PPD symptoms. First, while all 1920 participants screened positive for PPD symptoms, only 25.3% of participants sought help from a health care provider for PPD symptoms. Next, this research demonstrated the utility of an ensemble machine learning algorithm, Super Learner, to develop a best fitting model weighted by algorithm to identify the key variables associated with help-seeking. The AUCs for the overall model and the individual algorithms were high (87.95 % for the overall model). The most important variables were receiving a PPD diagnosis, depression during pregnancy, maternal BMI at the time the survey was completed, the state in which the mother lives, maternal race, and depression 3_months prior to pregnancy. When we reran the analysis with only those who attended a postpartum health care visit for themselves, the AUC remained high (87.08% for overall model). The most important variables in these algorithms were similar to the previous analysis, with variables related to depression history among the most important. Although most participants reported having been asked whether they were down or depressed (80.4%) and this variable had a significant bivariate relationship with help-seeking, this was not a top 10 variable in predicting help-seeking.
Similar to previous research with help-seeking among those with PPD, in this study, variables related to personal depression history were also among the most important predictors for help-seeking for PPD symptoms.19,20,24–27 Factors such as low mental health literacy, negative attitudes toward help-seeking, and low emotional clarity have all been demonstrated to be related to lack of personal and family experience with depression.18,21,24–27 Increased levels of mental health literacy have been found to be related to more positive attitudes toward professional mental health help-seeking among recently pregnant individuals.27 Recent research suggests that recently pregnant individuals and the public have misperceptions regarding perinatal mental health disorders in terms of symptoms, severity, risk, difference from “the baby blues,” and treatment, and these misperceptions can influence help-seeking.24 For example, believing perinatal mental health disorders are the same as “baby blues” can minimize the experience and discourage help-seeking. This research also suggests that most individuals experiencing perinatal mental health disorders prefer to seek informal help through friends and family believing it is effective treatment, rather than seek formal treatment, which is often necessary.24 The current research reinforces the need to promote PPD education among individuals, families, and the public.
Also similar to previous research, we found that maternal race was an important predictor for help-seeking,19,20,23,25,26 with lowest help-seeking for Asian American people followed by Black individuals. Cultural differences have a large impact on the manifestation of mental health concerns, help-seeking, provider interpretation of symptoms, and the relationship formed between the provider and patient.61 Indeed, research has consistently demonstrated that mental health help-seeking is low among Asian American individuals.23,62,63 Some reasons for this disparity include stigma and discrimination,64 negative attitudes toward mental health services,64 preference for informal (e.g. friends and family) rather than formal assistance (e.g. health care provider),65 and internalized stereotypes about the experience of mental health concerns among those who are Asian American.66 In addition, barriers to help-seeking and mental health utilization include a lack of culturally and ethnically relevant mental health services and providers.23,65 Help-seeking may be lower among Black individuals experiencing PPD symptoms due to stigma related to depression,61,67 a lack of trust for providers as a result of historical oppression and trauma,61,68 as well as systematic discrimination and racism.61 However, the impact of racism on help-seeking is unclear, as Bossick and others found that emotional upset due to racism was associated with greater PPD symptoms but not with decreased help-seeking.28
As noted above, when analyses were replicated with only those who attended a postpartum maternal health provider visit, depression before, during, and after pregnancy remained among the most important variables for predicting help-seeking. This revised analysis also permitted the inclusion of the variable “Asked by health care provider if they are depressed or down” that can serve as a proxy for PPD screening. Although reporting having been asked whether depressed or down demonstrated a significant positive relationship with help-seeking, interestingly, it was not among the most important predictors. While not a top predictor for help-seeking behavior in the current research, research demonstrates screening for PPD is critical, as it has shown an absolute risk reduction in PPD prevalence ranging between 2% and 9%.69 Recent efforts in the United States to increase screening for PPD include Medicaid coverage of maternal screening during child well visits. This represents an important step in increasing maternal screening since Medicaid currently covers nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States.70 Under Medicaid fee-for-service policies, currently, 43 states and Washington D.C. recommend, require, or allow coverage for screening;71 with only 8 of those states requiring PPD screening. In addition, some governing bodies specify screening should occur a minimum of one point in time,72 while others such as the American Academy of Pediatrics suggest a more robust PPD screening schedule at 1, 2, 4, and 6_months during well-child visits.73 More robust screening schedules provide additional opportunities to catch PPD symptoms when they are occurring.
Ensuring appropriate screening is only the first step to increase help-seeking for PPD symptoms. The provider response to screening is critical, as is the relationship between the provider and patient, and provider attitude and response to the individual’s disclosure.74–76 For example, feeling like one’s concerns are being dismissed or minimized will prevent individuals from further disclosure, while feeling encouraged or taken seriously will increase comfort and willingness to share. Having established and supportive relationships with providers will also facilitate help-seeking.75 Furthermore, provider outreach and follow-up is critical to increase patient help-seeking and treatment initiation.75
Benefits and limitations of machine learning ensemble methods
This analysis also demonstrated the utility of machine learning ensemble methods with data sets with many variables. These data-driven methods can successfully address the nonlinear and complex relationships that influence mental health-related behaviors like help-seeking.39 Machine learning models, such as random and conditional forest, are effective at handling multidimensional and complex data.77,78 Ensemble models typically include techniques that are nonlinear and nonparametric and therefore are flexible and robust to many different data types, yet can still find good fitting models.78 Instead of using a single model or method, we can improve model accuracy by gathering models into ensembles; the Super Learner improves model accuracy by combining several algorithms into a weighted average resulting in typically better performance than any single model.57,78,79 A strength and recommendation for implementing the Super Learner is to include a mix of various algorithms in the Super Learner and to evaluate not only the final model but each algorithm.57,79 Using a mix of algorithms in the Super Learner allows for confidence in overall performance since even though an individual algorithm may do well on some observations’ predictions, the individual algorithm’s overall performance could be worse than the Super Learner’s.57
Furthermore, machine learning models, including those that use ensemble methods, are good at creating models that can generalize to new data. Machine learning techniques include the random division of the data set into a training data set to develop the model and then a test data set to test the model with new data. If the pool of data is small, data splitting is a critical decision as a small test set’s ability to judge performance is limited.60 However, for large data sets, the size of training and test sets is less critical. A typical split in the data might be 80% for training and 20% for testing.60 Vabalas et al.80 showed that the train/test split approach produces robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. However, the higher the ratio of predictors to the number of observations, the more likely the machine learning algorithm will overfit the data and lead to poor performance on test data.80 In our analysis, since we have a relatively low number of predictors, our use of the 70% training and 30% testing split is justified. In addition, our test data set did a good job with prediction (e.g. AUCs in range of 0.8), suggesting our model would also predict well to a new data set that contained similar variables.59 Finally, the Super Learner is also adaptive and robust for small samples while controlling for overfitting.57
There are, however, limitations associated with ensemble methods. Ensemble models are more complex and can often lack of interpretability at the expense of having a very accurate predictive model.78 Compared to single-method models such as linear regression or random forest, more accurate prediction comes at the expense of model complexity; it is more challenging to determine the exact nature of relationships or to see which variables are important.78,79 This necessitates examination of bivariate relationships and comparison of variable importance across the different methods to help interpret relationships and findings. In addition, ensemble methods including the Super Learner are computationally intense requiring greater computing power and time compared to more traditional or single algorithm methods.78,79
Limitations and future research
This research is not without limitations. The item assessing the outcome, help-seeking, was only included in six states/jurisdictions, hindering our ability to generalize to the rest of the United States or other countries. After limiting our sample to those with PPD symptoms and other inclusion criteria (e.g. live birth/live infant during survey and participant is 18 or over), our sample comprised 13.2% of the total sample, which matches the current population prevalence estimates of PPD.1 Given the random sampling methods used by PRAMS, our findings should be representative for the six locations where this topic is assessed, hence providing the most comprehensive possible examination of this topic in the United States. This limitation of our research also highlights the need for greater systematic data collection and reporting on this topic.
An additional limitation includes the loss of variables during data preprocessing including variables with low variability, items that were missing as a result of skip logic, or because they were not asked by all locations. These items may have important implications for help-seeking among participants with PPD but could not be assessed in this study. Future research may examine these potentially related topics using smaller samples that have asked the relevant questions or are not missing data due to skip logic.
In addition, while much of the PRAMS data are based on birth certificate information, in this study, the outcome was a single, self-reported item from the questionnaire. As such, the outcome is subject to the limitations associated with self-report data including recall bias, or the inaccurate or incomplete memory of an experience, which may have influenced the quality of the data reported in this study.81 However, maternal recall of pregnancy-related behaviors, pregnancy outcomes, and postpartum behaviors such as breastfeeding have been found to be highly accurate when compared to patient charts, even as much as 30_years postpartum.82–84
In this study, among those who attended a postpartum visit for themselves, we do not know when their postpartum visit occurred, how many times the participant may have been asked about their own depression, nor when their present symptoms may have started. While PPD symptom onset typically occurs in early postpartum, or within 4_weeks of birth, late symptom onset (weeks 5–12 postpartum) can occur.85,86 Consequently, it is possible that participants’ symptoms may have started after their provider visit. Future research should replicate and confirm the results of this study using medical records rather than self-reported data.
Finally, this research was conducted using data gathered just prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to before the pandemic, the prevalence of PPD symptoms has been generally found to have increased, with estimates ranging from 7% to 80.8% among recently pregnant people.87 Risk factors such as lockdown, isolation, job loss, reduced access to healthcare, loss of childcare services, and fear of the baby contracting COVID-19 generally contributed to the increase in symptoms.87 While there has been an increase in need for mental health services during the pandemic,87 research has just started to examine the prevalence of help-seeking among individuals with PPD symptoms during and post-pandemic.88 Qualitative work suggests that reduced access and concerns about in-person appointments may have prevented in-person help-seeking for maternal mental health concerns and virtual alternatives were unable to adequately fulfill these needs.89 It will be important to replicate this research using data collected after the start of the pandemic."
Using machine learning with intensive longitudinal data to predict depression and suicidal ideation among medical interns over time,"Background. Use of intensive longitudinal methods (e.g. ecological momentary assessment, passive sensing) and machine learning (ML) models to predict risk for depression and suicide has increased in recent years. However, these studies often vary considerably in length, ML methods used, and sources of data. The present study examined predictive accuracy for depression and suicidal ideation (SI) as a function of time, comparing different combinations of ML methods and data sources. Methods. Participants were 2459 first-year training physicians (55.1% female; 52.5% White) who were provided with Fitbit wearable devices and assessed daily for mood. Linear [elastic net regression (ENR)] and non-linear (random forest) ML algorithms were used to predict depression and SI at the first-quarter follow-up assessment, using two sets of variables (daily mood features only, daily mood features + passive-sensing features). To assess accuracy over time, models were estimated iteratively for each of the first 92 days of internship, using data available up to that point in time. Results. ENRs using only the daily mood features generally had the best accuracy for predicting mental health outcomes, and predictive accuracy within 1 standard error of the full 92 day models was attained by weeks 7–8. Depression at 92 days could be predicted accurately (area under the curve >0.70) after only 14 days of data collection. Conclusions. Simpler ML methods may outperform more complex methods until passive-sensing features become better specified. For intensive longitudinal studies, there may be limited predictive value in collecting data for more than 2 months.  The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","This is the first study, to our knowledge, to utilize ILMs to predict depression and SI in a non-clinical sample across different time scales. The study's primary objective was to investigate relative benefits and tradeoffs concerning shorter v. more extended (until depression and ideation were assessed 92 days later) intensive data collection protocols. Our findings suggest that simple, daily mood assessments can predict depression 3 months out with reasonable accuracy after only 2 weeks, and that improvement in prediction accuracy for these distal outcomes tend to level off after about 7 weeks. Conversely, more time and assessment may be needed to predict SI accurately (approximately 7–8 weeks of data). Moreover, these general patterns varied as a function of adherence. As it pertains to missing data and depression, those responding more consistently had accurate predictions sooner, while those with high rates of missingness achieved similar predictive accuracy after approximately 5 weeks. With respect to missingness and SI, predictive accuracy was quite weak among those who responded inconsistently, even as assessment continued over time, whereas those with lower rates of missingness had steady improvements in predictive accuracy into the latter weeks of the 3 month period. Overall, the study's results suggest that, given the high participant burden and low adherence associated with ILMs over long periods of time, there may be limited value in continued data collection after about 7 weeks in this naturalistic sample. A key exception was observed for predicting SI, which continued to improve in accuracy with additional data collection. There may be key differences in the stability of depression and SI that places greater value on more proximate assessments for the prediction of SI, at least with respect to daily mood assessments.

Another notable finding in this study was that, despite enthusiasm for the role of passive sensing and complex ML methods in mental health research (Burke et al., Reference Burke, Ammerman and Jacobucci2019; Colombo et al., Reference Colombo, Fernández-Álvarez, Patané, Semonella, Kwiatkowska, García-Palacios and Botella2019), simpler algorithms (ENRs) with only mood-derived predictors were either equivalent or outperformed more complex RF models with mood and passive-sensing (Fitbit) predictors. This is likely due to the implicit feature selection performed by the elastic net algorithm shrinking the weights of the Fitbit variables, and the fact that inclusion of Fitbit predictors in the more complex RF non-linear algorithms did not improve performance over mood data alone. The sharp decrease in performance for RF models when Fitbit variables were included suggests these variables were simply adding noise, rather than a meaningful predictive signal. While there remains significant potential, and a reduction of burden, associated with passive sensing, these features require additional refinement to maximize their potential (Sheikh, Qassem, & Kyriacou, Reference Sheikh, Qassem and Kyriacou2021).

In the current study, end-of-quarter depression was detected with acceptable accuracy as early as the first 2 weeks of internship. Given this potential to detect early states of vulnerability, particularly depression, under naturalistic conditions, there are significant implications for preventative interventions. Specifically, adaptive interventions use ongoing information about individuals' functioning or treatment progress to modify aspects pertaining to the type, intensity, or modality used to deliver the treatment (Nahum-Shani et al., Reference Nahum-Shani, Qian, Almirall, Pelham, Gnagy, Fabiano and Murphy2012). Examining early signs of impending depressive symptoms or SI could be beneficial for operationalizing when and for whom support is indicated, and as soon as such signs are identified. More work is needed to further examine the utility of ILMs in detecting states of vulnerability to mental health outcomes to guide personalized interventions by specifying the conditions in which interventions should be provided, in different contexts and populations.

Our work also highlights tradeoffs concerning maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing response burden, and when such balance can be achieved (e.g. low v. high missingness). Briefer ILD protocols that achieve similar predictive accuracy may be more practical in naturalistic studies or clinical contexts. For example, model performance using daily diary data in the weeks following psychiatric hospitalization was similar when using 1 v. 2 weeks of data in predicting subsequent suicidal crises (Czyz, Koo, Al-Dajani, King, & Nahum-Shani, Reference Czyz, Koo, Al-Dajani, King and Nahum-Shani2021). Given the challenges associated with participation decay over time in intensive longitudinal studies (e.g. Czyz et al., Reference Czyz, King and Nahum-Shani2018; Glenn et al., Reference Glenn, Kleiman, Kearns, Santee, Esposito, Conwell and Alpert-Gillis2020), our findings suggest there may be opportunities to modify assessment schedules to lessen attrition without compromising predictive validity.

Limitations
While this study has many strengths, including a very large sample incorporating self-report and passive-sensing ILD, as well as a rigorous statistical approach, our findings must be taken within the context of study limitations. With respect to measurement, while the PHQ-9 is widely used as a screener and tracker of depressive symptoms, scores do not necessarily reflect a clinical diagnosis of depression. Likewise, our measure of SI from this scale does not permit the distinction between passive and active suicidal thoughts, including the presence of its more severe forms (e.g. ideation with methods or intent). Our sample of medical interns was fairly diverse with respect to gender and race/ethnicity, yet the medical intern population is inherently homogenous with respect to education and occupation. There may also be aspects of the intern work schedule that result in patterns of sleep or activity that do not mirror the general population with respect to associations with depression and SI, resulting in non-significant findings for passive-sensing data. Intensive longitudinal designs often examine both proximal (i.e. next-day) and distal outcomes (i.e. months), and it should be noted that our findings are primarily focused on distal outcomes – we would not expect our predictive accuracy findings over time to follow the same patterns for more proximal outcomes. We note that various hierarchical structures may be present for these data (e.g. individuals nested within institutions or within specialties). We had no specific hypotheses about differences across these higher-level factors and we opted not to specify nesting within our models. However, modeling such dependencies could potentially improve predictive performance in future studies. We also acknowledge that we only compared two types of ML models, and that results may differ across other ML models of varying complexity. Finally, it is worth noting that the overall model accuracy for predicting depression and SI was merely good, but not excellent (AUC < 0.80), and there is room to improve methods for both passive-sensing and self-report assessments.

Conclusions
ILMs provide significant opportunities for improved monitoring of mental health conditions and risk detection for both proximal and distal mental health outcomes. Despite enthusiasm for sophisticated ML methods, simpler ENRs based only on self-reported data outperformed the more complex RF models incorporating both self-report and passing-sensing features. While data were collected daily for 13 weeks, predictive accuracy for depression and SI improved minimally after weeks 7–8, suggesting that daily data collection for more than 2 months may have limited value for predicting distal outcomes. Additionally, acceptable predictive accuracy for moderate-to-severe depression at the end of the quarter was attained after only 2 weeks, highlighting the potential and need for early interventions that can adaptively respond to individuals at risk for these negative mental health outcomes.
